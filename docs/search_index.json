The syllabus uses fancy language to describe the topics covered on the exam, making it sound more difficult than it should be. A good analogy is a job description that has many complex-sounding tasks, when in reality the day-to-day operations of the employee are far simpler. https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2019/2019-12-exam-pa-syllabus.pdf A non-technical translation is as follows: Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%) Write in professional language Type more than 50 words-per-minute Manipulating Data in R (15-25%) Quickly clean data sets Find data errors planted by the SOA Perform queries (aggregations, summaries, transformations) Making decisions based on machine learning and statistics knowledge (40-50%) Understand several algorithms from a high level and be able to interpret and explain results in english Read R documentation about models and use this to make decisions "],
["what-is-machine-learning.html", "Chapter 3 What is machine learning?", " Chapter 3 What is machine learning? All of use are already familiar with how to learn - by improving from our mistakes. By repeating what is successful and avoiding what results in failure, we learn by doing, by experience, or trial-and-error. Machines learn in a similar way. Take for example the process of studying for an exam. Some study methods work well, but other methods do not. We all know that memorizing answers without understanding concepts is an ineffective method, and that by quizing ourselves on realistic questions we can learn fastest. Later, when we walk about cross-validation, we will see that computers do just this. We can clearly state our objective: get as many correct answers as possible! We want to correctly predict the solution to every problem. Said another way, we are trying to minimize the error, the percentage of incorrect problems. If instead we measure progress based on a different metric, say hours studied for instance, we will be incentivized to waste time instead of doing work. We will see that choosing a model’s loss function performs the same action. The “data” are the practice problems, and the “label” is the answer (A,B,C,D,E). We want to build a “mental model” that reads the question and predicts the answer. The SOA suggests 100 hours per hour of exam, which means that actuaries train on hundreds of problems before the real exam. The more practice problems that we do, the larger the training data set, and the better our “mental model” becomes. When we see new problems, ones which have not appeared in the practice exams, we often have a difficult time. But unlike computers, we don’t have the ability to use parallel cores, to run continuously for hours on end, and have limited memory. This means that we also need to study strategically, which is what this book will help with. "],
["getting-started.html", "Chapter 4 Getting started 4.1 Download ISLR 4.2 Installing R 4.3 Installing RStudio 4.4 Set the R library 4.5 Download the data", " Chapter 4 Getting started This book is designed to get you set up within an hour. If this is your first time using R, then you will need to install two pieces of software, R and RStudio. Once these four steps have been done you should not need to download anything else needed for this book. You will be able to work offline. 4.1 Download ISLR This book references the publically-avialable textbook “An Introduction to Statistical Learning”, which can be downloaded for free http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 4.2 Installing R This is the engine that runs the code. https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html 4.3 Installing RStudio This is the tool that helps you to write the code. Just as MS Word creates documents, RStudio creates R scripts and other documents. Download RStudio Desktop (the free edition) and choose a place on your computer to install it. https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 4.4 Set the R library R code is organized into libraries. You want to use the exact same code that will be on the Prometric Computers. This requires installing older versions of libraries. Change your R library to the one which was included within the SOA’s modules. #.libPaths(&quot;PATH_TO_SOAS_LIBRARY/PAlibrary&quot;) 4.5 Download the data For your convenience, all data in this book, including data from prior exams and sample solutions, has been put into a library called ExamPAData by the author. To access, simplly run the below lines of code to download this data. #check if devtools is installed and then install ExamPAData from github if(&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()){ library(devtools) install_github(&quot;https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData&quot;) } else{ install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData&quot;) } Once this has run, you can access the data using library(ExamPAData). To check that this is installed correctly see if the insurance data set has loaded. If this returns “object not found”, then the library was not installed. library(ExamPAData) summary(insurance) ## district group age holders ## Min. :1.00 Length:64 Length:64 Min. : 3.00 ## 1st Qu.:1.75 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 46.75 ## Median :2.50 Mode :character Mode :character Median : 136.00 ## Mean :2.50 Mean : 364.98 ## 3rd Qu.:3.25 3rd Qu.: 327.50 ## Max. :4.00 Max. :3582.00 ## claims ## Min. : 0.00 ## 1st Qu.: 9.50 ## Median : 22.00 ## Mean : 49.23 ## 3rd Qu.: 55.50 ## Max. :400.00 "],
["r-programming.html", "Chapter 5 R programming 5.1 Notebook chunks 5.2 Basic operations 5.3 Lists 5.4 Functions 5.5 Data frames 5.6 Pipes", " Chapter 5 R programming There are already many great R tutorials available. To save time, this book will cover the absolute essentials. The book “R for Data Science” provides one such introduction. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ 5.1 Notebook chunks On the Exam, you will start with an .Rmd (R Markdown) template. The way that this book writes code is in the R Notebook. Learning markdown is useful for other web development and documentation tasks as well. Code is organized into chunks. To run everything in a chunk quickly, press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER. To create a new chunk, use CTRL + ALT + I. 5.2 Basic operations The usual math operations apply. #addition 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 3 - 2 ## [1] 1 #multiplication 2*2 ## [1] 4 #division 4/2 ## [1] 2 #exponentiation 2^3 ## [1] 8 There are two assignment operators: = and &lt;-. The latter is preferred because it is specific to assigning a variable to a value. The “=” operator is also used for assigning values in functions (see the functions section). In R, the shortcut ALT + - creates a &lt;-. #variable assignment x = 2 y &lt;- 2 #equality 4 == 2 #False ## [1] FALSE 5 == 5 #true ## [1] TRUE 3.14 &gt; 3 #true ## [1] TRUE 3.14 &gt;= 3 #true ## [1] TRUE Vectors can be added just like numbers. The c stands for “concatenate”, which creates vectors. x &lt;- c(1,2) y &lt;- c(3,4) x + y ## [1] 4 6 x*y ## [1] 3 8 z &lt;- x + y z^2 ## [1] 16 36 z/2 ## [1] 2 3 z + 3 ## [1] 7 9 Lists are like vectors but can take any type of object type. I already mentioned numeric types. There are also character (string) types, factor types, and boolean types. character &lt;- &quot;The&quot; character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;The&quot;, &quot;Quick&quot;) Factors are characters that expect only specific values. A character can take on any value. A factor is only allowed a finite number of values. This reduces the memory size. The below factor has only one “level”, which is the list of assigned values. factor = as.factor(character) levels(factor) ## [1] &quot;The&quot; The levels of a factor are by default in R in alphabetical order (Q comes alphabetically before T). factor_vector &lt;- as.factor(character_vector) levels(factor_vector) ## [1] &quot;Quick&quot; &quot;The&quot; Booleans are just True and False values. R understands T or TRUE in the same way. When doing math, bools are converted to 0/1 values where 1 is equivalent to TRUE and 0 FALSE. bool_true &lt;- T bool_false &lt;- F bool_true*bool_false ## [1] 0 Vectors work in the same way. bool_vect &lt;- c(T,T, F) sum(bool_vect) ## [1] 2 Vectors are indexed using []. abc &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) abc[1] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; abc[2] ## [1] &quot;b&quot; abc[c(1,3)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; abc[c(1,2)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; abc[-2] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; abc[-c(2,3)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; 5.3 Lists Lists are vectors that can hold mixed object types. Vectors need to be all of the same type. ls &lt;- list(T, &quot;Character&quot;, 3.14) ls ## [[1]] ## [1] TRUE ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;Character&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3.14 Lists can be named. ls &lt;- list(bool = T, character = &quot;character&quot;, numeric = 3.14) ls ## $bool ## [1] TRUE ## ## $character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $numeric ## [1] 3.14 The $ operator indexes lists. ls$numeric ## [1] 3.14 ls$numeric + 5 ## [1] 8.14 Lists can also be indexed using []. ls[1] ## $bool ## [1] TRUE ls[2] ## $character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Lists can contain vectors, other lists, and any other object. everything &lt;- list(vector = c(1,2,3), character = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), list = ls) everything ## $vector ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## $character ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; ## ## $list ## $list$bool ## [1] TRUE ## ## $list$character ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## $list$numeric ## [1] 3.14 To find out the type of an object, use class or str or summary. class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(everything) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; str(everything) ## List of 3 ## $ vector : num [1:3] 1 2 3 ## $ character: chr [1:3] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; ## $ list :List of 3 ## ..$ bool : logi TRUE ## ..$ character: chr &quot;character&quot; ## ..$ numeric : num 3.14 summary(everything) ## Length Class Mode ## vector 3 -none- numeric ## character 3 -none- character ## list 3 -none- list 5.4 Functions You only need to understand the very basics of functions for this exam. Still, understanding functions helps you to understand everything in R, since R is a functional programming language, unlike Python, C, VBA, Java which are all object-oriented, or SQL which isn’t really a language but a series of set-operations. Functions do things. The convention is to name a function as a verb. The function make_rainbows() would create a rainbow. The function summarise_vectors would summarise vectors. Functions may or may not have an input and output. If you need to do something in R, there is a high probability that someone has already written a function to do it. That being said, creating simple functions is quite useful. A function that does not return anything greet_me &lt;- function(my_name){ print(paste0(&quot;Hello, &quot;, my_name)) } greet_me(&quot;Future Actuary&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, Future Actuary&quot; A function that returns something When returning something, the return statement is optional. add_together &lt;- function(x, y){ x + y } add_together(2,5) ## [1] 7 add_together &lt;- function(x, y){ return(x + y) } add_together(2,5) ## [1] 7 Functions can work with vectors. x_vector &lt;- c(1,2,3) y_vector &lt;- c(4,5,6) add_together(x_vector, y_vector) ## [1] 5 7 9 5.5 Data frames R is an old programming language. The original data.frame object has been updated with the newer and better tibble (like the word “table”). Tibbles are really lists of vectors, where each column is a vector. library(tibble) #the tibble library has functions for making tibbles data &lt;- tibble(age = c(25, 35), has_fsa = c(F, T)) data ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## age has_fsa ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 25 FALSE ## 2 35 TRUE To index columns in a tibble, the same “$” is used as indexing a list. data$age ## [1] 25 35 To find the number of rows and columns, use dim. dim(data) ## [1] 2 2 To fine a summary, use summary summary(data) ## age has_fsa ## Min. :25.0 Mode :logical ## 1st Qu.:27.5 FALSE:1 ## Median :30.0 TRUE :1 ## Mean :30.0 ## 3rd Qu.:32.5 ## Max. :35.0 5.6 Pipes The pipe operator %&gt;% is a way of making code more readable and easier to edit. The way that we are taught to do functional composition is by nesting, which is slow to read and write. In five seconds, tell me what the below code is doing. log(sqrt(exp(log2(sqrt((max(c(3, 4, 16)))))))) ## [1] 1 Did you get the answer of 1? If so, you are good at reading parenthesis. This requires starting from the inner-most nested brackets and moving outwards from right to left. The math notation would be slightly easier to read, but still painful. \\[log(\\sqrt{e^{log_2(\\sqrt{max(3,4,16)})}})\\] Here is the same algebra using the pipe. To read this, replace the %&gt;% with the word THEN. library(dplyr) #the pipe is from the dplyr library max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log() ## [1] 1 #max(c(3, 4, 16) THEN #The max of 3, 4, and 16 is 16 # sqrt() THEN #The square root of 16 is 4 # log2() THEN #The log in base 2 of 4 is 2 # exp() THEN #the exponent of 2 is e^2 # sqrt() THEN #the square root of e^2 is e # log() #the natural logarithm of e is 1 You may not be convinced by this simple example using numbers; however, once we get to data manipulations in the next section the advantage of piping will become obvious. To quickly produce pipes, use CTRL + SHIFT + M. By highlighting only certain sections, we can run the code in steps as if we were using a debugger. This makes testing out code much faster. max(c(3, 4, 16)) ## [1] 16 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() ## [1] 4 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() ## [1] 2 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() ## [1] 7.389056 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() ## [1] 2.718282 max(c(3, 4, 16)) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log() ## [1] 1 Those familiar with Python’s Pandas will be see that %&gt;% is quite similar to “.”.

In the real exam, you will read the file from the Prometric computer. To read files into R, the readr package has several tools, one for each data format. For instance, the most common format, comma separated values (csv) are read with the read_csv() function. Because the data is already loaded, simply use the below code to access the data. library(ExamPAData) 6.1 Look at the data The data that we are using is health_insurance, which has information on patients and their health care costs. The descriptions of the columns are below. The technical name for this is a “data dictionary”, and one will be provided to you on the real exam. age: Age of the individual sex: Sex bmi: Body Mass Index children: Number of children smoker: Is this person a smoker? region: Region charges: Annual health care costs. head() shows the top n rows. head(20) shows the top 20 rows. library(tidyverse) head(health_insurance) ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## age sex bmi children smoker region charges ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 19 female 27.9 0 yes southwest 16885. ## 2 18 male 33.8 1 no southeast 1726. ## 3 28 male 33 3 no southeast 4449. ## 4 33 male 22.7 0 no northwest 21984. ## 5 32 male 28.9 0 no northwest 3867. ## 6 31 female 25.7 0 no southeast 3757. Using a pipe is an alternative way of doing this. Because this is more time-efficient, this will be the preferred method in this manual. health_insurance %&gt;% head() The glimpse function is a transpose of the head() function, which can be more spatially efficient. This also gives you the dimension (1,338 rows, 7 columns). health_insurance %&gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 1,338 ## Variables: 7 ## $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 18, 28, 33, 32, 31, 46, 37, 37, 60, 25, 62, 23, 5... ## $ sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;... ## $ bmi &lt;dbl&gt; 27.900, 33.770, 33.000, 22.705, 28.880, 25.740, 33.44... ## $ children &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,... ## $ smoker &lt;chr&gt; &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;... ## $ region &lt;chr&gt; &quot;southwest&quot;, &quot;southeast&quot;, &quot;southeast&quot;, &quot;northwest&quot;, &quot;... ## $ charges &lt;dbl&gt; 16884.924, 1725.552, 4449.462, 21984.471, 3866.855, 3... One of the most useful data science tools is counting things. The function count() gives the number of records by a categorical feature. health_insurance %&gt;% count(children) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## children n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 574 ## 2 1 324 ## 3 2 240 ## 4 3 157 ## 5 4 25 ## 6 5 18 Two categories can be counted at once. This creates a table with all combinations of cut and color and shows the number of records in each category. health_insurance %&gt;% count(region, sex) ## # A tibble: 8 x 3 ## region sex n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 northeast female 161 ## 2 northeast male 163 ## 3 northwest female 164 ## 4 northwest male 161 ## 5 southeast female 175 ## 6 southeast male 189 ## 7 southwest female 162 ## 8 southwest male 163 The summary() function is shows a statistical summary. One caveat is that each column needs to be in it’s appropriate type. For example, smoker, region, and sex are all listed as characters when if they were factors, summary would give you count info.

For those Excel users out there, this can be interpreted as “what Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and SUMIFF do”. R syntax is designed to be similar to SQL. They begin with a SELECT, use GROUP BY to aggregate, and have a WHERE to remove records. Unlike SQL, the ordering of these does not matter. SELECT can come after a WHERE. R to SQL translation select() -&gt; SELECT mutate() -&gt; user-defined columns summarize() -&gt; aggregated columns left_join() -&gt; LEFT JOIN filter() -&gt; WHERE group_by() -&gt; GROUP BY filter() -&gt; HAVING arrange() -&gt; ORDER BY health_insurance %&gt;% select(age, region) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## age region ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 19 southwest ## 2 18 southeast ## 3 28 southeast ## 4 33 northwest ## 5 32 northwest ## 6 31 southeast Tip: use CTRL + SHIFT + M to create pipes %&gt;%. Let’s look at only those in the southeast region. Instead of WHERE, use filter. health_insurance %&gt;% filter(region == &quot;southeast&quot;) %&gt;% select(age, region) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## age region ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 18 southeast ## 2 28 southeast ## 3 31 southeast ## 4 46 southeast ## 5 62 southeast ## 6 56 southeast The SQL translation is SELECT age, region FROM health_insurance WHERE region = &#39;southeast&#39; Instead of ORDER BY, use arrange. Unlike SQL, the order does not matter and ORDER BY doesn’t need to be last. health_insurance %&gt;% arrange(age) %&gt;% select(age, region) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## age region ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 18 southeast ## 2 18 southeast ## 3 18 northeast ## 4 18 northeast ## 5 18 northeast ## 6 18 southeast The group_by comes before the aggregation, unlike in SQL where the GROUP BY comes last. health_insurance %&gt;% group_by(region) %&gt;% summarise(avg_age = mean(age)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## region avg_age ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 northeast 39.3 ## 2 northwest 39.2 ## 3 southeast 38.9 ## 4 southwest 39.5 In SQL, this would be SELECT region, AVG(age) as avg_age FROM health_insurance GROUP BY region Just like in SQL, many different aggregate functions can be used such as SUM, MEAN, MIN, MAX, and so forth. health_insurance %&gt;% group_by(region) %&gt;% summarise(avg_age = mean(age), max_age = max(age), median_charges = median(charges), bmi_std_dev = sd(bmi)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## region avg_age max_age median_charges bmi_std_dev ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 northeast 39.3 64 10058. 5.94 ## 2 northwest 39.2 64 8966. 5.14 ## 3 southeast 38.9 64 9294. 6.48 ## 4 southwest 39.5 64 8799. 5.69 To create new columns, the mutate function is used.

Create a plot object (ggplot) 7.3 Step 3: Add a plot", " Chapter 7 Visualization The creator’s of the exam do not expect candidates to be expert data scientists. Being able to create basic one-dimensional graphs and to interpret results is most important. Creating graphs in R is easy. The most popular way to do this is with the ggplot library. Three-Steps: 7.1 Step 1. Put the data in a pivotable format Excel users will know this as “pivot-table format”, or the way that a table is organized so it can be put into a pivot table. This is also known as “tidy format”. There is one-row per record and one column per variable. 7.1.1 Example of “wide” or “matrix” format The data below contains counts on a survey which asked people about their religion and annual income. religion is stored in the rows income is spread across the columns This is difficult to work with because there are a lot of columns. ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## religion `&lt;$10k` `$10-20k` `$20-30k` `$30-40k` `$40-50k` `$50-75k` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Agnostic 27 34 60 81 76 137 ## 2 Atheist 12 27 37 52 35 70 ## 3 Buddhist 27 21 30 34 33 58 ## 4 Catholic 418 617 732 670 638 1116 ## 5 Don’t k~ 15 14 15 11 10 35 ## 6 Evangel~ 575 869 1064 982 881 1486 ## # ... with 4 more variables: `$75-100k` &lt;dbl&gt;, `$100-150k` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `&gt;150k` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Don&#39;t know/refused` &lt;dbl&gt; 7.1.2 Example of “pivotable”, “long”, or “tidy” format Here is the same data only in a long format. You don’t need to know how to switch between the two for now, but only that the long format is what is needed to create graphs. 7.2 Step 2. Create a plot object (ggplot) The first step is to create a blank canvas that holds the columns that are needed. Let’s say that the goal is to graph income and count. We put these into a ggplot object called p. The aesthetic argument, aes, means that the x-axis will have income and the y-axis will have count. p &lt;- data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = income, y = count)) If we look at p, we see that it is nothing but white space with axis for count and income. p 7.3 Step 3: Add a plot We add an xy plot. p + geom_point() We can also create a bar plot. p + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Creating histograms is even easier. Just specify the column that you want to graph as the x column. No y is needed because a histogram is one-dimensional. Take a x to be a random variable from a gamma distribution. gamma = tibble(x = rgamma(1000, shape = 1, rate = 2)) p &lt;- gamma %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x)) p + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. We can graph a density instead of a histogram by using geom_density instead of geom_hist. p + geom_density(fill = &quot;grey&quot;) "],
["linear-models.html", "Chapter 8 Linear Models 8.1 Model Notation 8.2 Ordinary least squares (OLS) 8.3 Generalized linear models (GLMs) 8.4 Penalized Linear Models", " Chapter 8 Linear Models 8.1 Model Notation The number of observations will be denoted by \\(n\\). When we refer to the size of a data set, we are referring to \\(n\\). We use \\(p\\) to refer the number of input variables used. The word “variables” is synonymous with “features”. For example, in the health_insurance data, the variables are age, sex, bmi, children, smoker and region. These 7 variables mean that \\(p = 7\\). The data is collected from 1,338 patients, which means that \\(n = 1,338\\). Scalar numbers are denoted by ordinary variables (i.e., \\(x = 2\\), \\(z = 4\\)), and vectors are denoted by bold-faced letters \\[\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] We use \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) to denote the target variable. This is the variable which we are trying to predict. This can be either a whole number, in which case we are performing regression, or a category, in which case we are performing classification. In the health insurance example, y = charges, which are the annual health care costs for a patient. Both \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) are important because they tell us what types of models are likely to work well, and which methods are likely to fail. For the PA exam, we will be dealing with small \\(n\\) (&lt;100,000) due to the limitations of the Prometric computers. We will use a small \\(p\\) (&lt; 20) in order to make the data sets easier to interpret. We organize these variables into matrices. Take an example with \\(p\\) = 2 columns and 3 observations. The matrix is said to be \\(3 \\times 2\\) (read as “2-by-3”) matrix. \\[ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix}x_{11} &amp; x_{21}\\\\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22}\\\\ x_{31} &amp; x_{32} \\end{pmatrix} \\] The target is \\[\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] This represents the unknown quantity that we want to be able to predict. In the health care costs example, \\(y_1\\) would be the costs of the first patient, \\(y_2\\) the costs of the second patient, and so forth. The variables \\(x_{11}\\) and \\(x_{12}\\) might represent the first patient’s age and sex respectively, where \\(x_{i1}\\) is the patient’s age, and \\(x_{i2} = 1\\) if the ith patient is male and 0 if female. Machine learning is about using \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) to predict \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). We call this “y-hat”, or simply the prediction. This is based on a function of the data \\(X\\). \\[\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = f(\\mathbf{X}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{y_1} \\\\ \\hat{y_2} \\\\ \\hat{y_3} \\end{pmatrix}\\] This is almost never going to happen perfectly, and so there is always an error term, \\(\\mathbf{\\epsilon}\\). This can be made smaller, but is never exactly zero. \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} + \\mathbf{\\epsilon} = f(\\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{\\epsilon} \\] In other words, \\(\\epsilon = y - \\hat{y}\\). We call this the residual. When we predict a person’s health care costs, this is the difference between the predicted costs (which we had created the year before) and the actual costs that the patient experienced (of that current year). 8.2 Ordinary least squares (OLS) The type of model used refers to the class of function of \\(f\\). If \\(f\\) is linear, then we are using a linear model. If \\(f\\) is non-parametric (does not have input parameters), then it is non-parametric modeling. Linear models are the simplest type of model. We have the data \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and the target \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), where all of the y’s are real numbers, or \\(y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). We want to find a \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) so that \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\] Which means that each \\(y_i\\) is a linear combination of the variables \\(x_1, ..., x_p\\), plus a constant \\(\\beta_0\\) which is called the intercept term. \\[ \\begin{equation} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... + \\beta_p x_p \\end{equation} \\] In the one-dimensional case, this creates a line connecting the points. In higher dimensions, this creates a hyperplane. The question then is how can we choose the best values of \\(\\beta?\\) First of all, we need to define what we mean by “best”. Ideally, we will choose these values which will create close predictions of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) on new, unseen data. To solve for \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\), we first need to define a loss function. This allows us to compare how well a model is fitting the data. The most commonly used loss function is the residual sum of squares (RSS), also called the squared error loss or the L2 norm. When RSS is small, then the predictions are close to the actual values and the model is a good fit. When RSS is large, the model is a poor fit. \\[ \\text{RSS} = \\sum_i(y_i - \\hat{y})^2 \\] When you replace \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) in the above equation with \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... + \\beta_p x_p\\), take the derivative with respect to \\(\\beta\\), set equal to zero, and solve, we can find the optimal values. This turns the problem of statistics into a problem of numeric optimization, which computers can do quickly. You might be asking: why does this need to be the squared error? Why not the absolute error, or the cubed error? Technically, these could be used as well. In fact, the absolute error (L1 norm) is useful in other models. Taking the square has a number of advantages. It provides the same solution if we assume that the distribution of \\(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X}\\) is guassian and maximize the likelihood function. This method is used for GLMs, in the next chapter. Empirically it has been shown to be less likely to overfit as compared to other loss functions 8.2.1 Example In our health, we can create a linear model using bmi, age, and sex as an inputs. The formula controls which variables are included. There are a few shortcuts for using R formulas. Formula Meaning charges ~ bmi + age Use age and bmi to predict charges charges ~ bmi + age + bmi*age Use age,bmi as well as an interaction to predict charges charges ~ (bmi &gt; 20) + age Use an indicator variable for bmi &gt; 20 age to predict charges log(charges) ~ log(bmi) + log(age) Use the logs of age and bmi to predict log(charges) You can use formulas to create new variables (aka feature engineering). This can save you from needing to re-run code to create data. Below we fit a simple linear model to predict charges. library(ExamPAData) library(tidyverse) model &lt;- lm(data = health_insurance, formula = charges ~ bmi + age) The summary function gives details about the model. First, the Estimate, gives you the coefficients. The Std. Error is the error of the estimate for the coefficient. Higher standard error means greater uncertainty. This is relative to the average value of that variable. The t value tells you how “big” this error really is based on standard deviations. A larger t value implies a low probability of the null hypothesis being rejected saying that the coefficient is zero. This is the same as having a p-value (Pr (&gt;|t|))) being close to zero. The little *, **, *** indicate that the variable is either somewhat significant, significant, or highly significant. “significance” here means that there is a low probability of the coefficient being that size if there were no actual casual relationship, or if the data was random noise. summary(model) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = charges ~ bmi + age, data = health_insurance) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -14457 -7045 -5136 7211 48022 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

To look at performance, test the model on validation data. This can be done by a) using a hold out set, or b) using cross-validation, which is even better. Let’s create an 80% training set and 20% testing set. You don’t need to worry about understanding this code as the exam will always give this to you. library(caret) #create a train/test split index &lt;- createDataPartition(y = health_insurance$charges, p = 0.8, list = F) %&gt;% as.numeric() health_insurance_train &lt;- health_insurance %&gt;% slice(index) health_insurance_test &lt;- health_insurance %&gt;% slice(-index) Train the model on the health_insurance_train and test on health_insurance_test. model &lt;- lm(data = health_insurance_train, formula = charges ~ bmi + age) pred = predict(model, health_insurance_test) Let’s look at the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). get_rmse &lt;- function(y, y_hat){ mean((y - y_hat)^2) } get_rmse(pred, health_insurance_test$charges) ## [1] 136311561 The above number does not tell us if this is a good model or not by itself. We need a comparison. The fastest check is to compare against a prediction of the mean. In other words, all values of the y_hat are the average of charges get_rmse(mean(health_insurance_test$charges), health_insurance_test$charges) ## [1] 157467239 The RMSE is higher (worse) when predicting the mean, which is what we expect. If you ever fit a model and get an error which is worse than the average prediction, something must be wrong. The next test is to see if any assumptions have been violated. First, is there a pattern in the residuals? If there is, this means that the model is missing key information. For the model below, this is a yes, which means that this is a bad model. Because this is just for illustration, I’m going to continue using it, however. plot(model, which = 1) Figure 8.1: Residuals vs. Fitted The normal QQ shows how well the quantiles of the predictions fit to a theoretical normal distribution. If this is true, then the graph is a straight 45-degree line. In this model, you can definitely see that this is not the case. If this were a good model, this distribution would be closer to normal. plot(model, which = 2) Figure 8.2: Normal Q-Q Caution: This test only applies to linear models which have a gaussian response distribution. The below is from an excellent post of Stack Exchange. R does not have a distinct plot.glm() method. When you fit a model with glm() and run plot(), it calls ?plot.lm, which is appropriate for linear models (i.e., with a normally distributed error term). More specifically, the plots will often ‘look funny’ and lead people to believe that there is something wrong with the model when it is perfectly fine. We can see this by looking at those plots with a couple of simple simulations where we know the model is correct: Once you have chosen your model, you should re-train over the entire data set. This is to make the coefficients more stable because n is larger. Below you can see that the standard error is lower after training over the entire data set. model_full_data &lt;- lm(data = health_insurance, formula = charges ~ bmi + age) model_test_data &lt;- lm(data = health_insurance_train, formula = charges ~ bmi + age) term full_data_std_error test_data_std_error (Intercept) 1744.1 1939.6 bmi 51.4 57.1 age 22.3 24.9 All interpretations should be based on the model which was trained on the entire data set. Obviously, this only makes a difference if you are interpreting the precise values of the coefficients. If you are just looking at which variables are included, or at the size and sign of the coefficients, then this would not change. coefficients(model_full_data) ## (Intercept) bmi age ## -6424.8046 332.9651 241.9308 Translating the above into an equation we have \\[\\hat{y_i} = -6,424.80 + 332.97 \\space\\text{bmi} + 241.93\\space \\text{age}\\] For example, if a patient has bmi = 27.9 and age = 19 then predicted value is \\[\\hat{y_1} = -6,424.80 + (332.97)(27.9) + (241.93)(19) = 7,461.73\\] This model structure implies that each of the variables \\(\\mathbf{x_1}, ..., \\mathbf{x_p}\\) each change the predicted \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\). If \\(x_{ij}\\) increases by one unit, then \\(y_i\\) increases by \\(\\beta_j\\) units, regardless of what happens to all of the other variables. This is one of the main assumptions of linear models: variable indepdendence. If the variables are correlated, say, then this assumption will be violated. Readings ISLR 2.1 What is statistical learning? ISLR 2.2 Assessing model accuracy 8.3 Generalized linear models (GLMs) Instead of the model being a direct linear combination of the variables, there is an intermediate step called a link function \\(g\\). \\[ g(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\] This implies that the response \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is related to the linear predictor \\(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}\\) through the inverse link function. \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = g^-1(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}) \\] This means that \\(g(.)\\) must be an invertable. For example, if \\(g\\) is the natural logarithm (aka, the “log-link”), then \\[ log(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = e^{\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}} \\] This is useful when the distribution of \\(Y\\) is skewed, as taking the log corrects skewness. Figure 8.3: Taking the log corrects for skewness You might be asking, what if the distribution of \\(Y\\) is not normal, no matter what choice we have for \\(g\\)? The short answer is that we can change our assumption of the distribution of \\(Y\\), and use this to change the parameters. If you have taken exam STAM then you are familiar with maximum likelihood estimation. We have a response \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), and we fit a distribution to \\(\\mathbf{Y} | \\mathbf{X}\\). This is the target variable conditioned on the data. For each \\(y_i\\), each observation, we assign a probability \\(f_Y(y_i)\\) \\[ f_y(y_i | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ..., X_p = x_p) = Pr(Y = y_i | \\mathbf{X}) \\] Now, when we choose the response family, we are simply changing \\(f_Y\\). If we say that the response family is Gaussian, then \\(f\\) has a Gaussian PDF. If we are modeling counts, then \\(f\\) is a Poisson PDF. This only works if \\(f\\) is in the exponential family of distributions, which consists of the common names such as Gaussian, Binomial, Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and so forth. Reading the CAS Monograph 5 will provide more detail into this. The possible combinations of link functions and distribution families are summarized nicely on Wikipedia. Figure 8.4: Distribution-Link Function Combinations For this exam, a common question is to ask candiates to choose the best distribution and link function. There is no all-encompasing answer, but a few suggestions are If \\(Y\\) is counting something, such as the number of claims, number of accidents, or some other discrete and positive counting sequence, use the Poisson; If \\(Y\\) contains negative values, then do not use the Exponential, Gamma, or Inverse Gaussian as these are strictly positive. Conversely, if \\(Y\\) is only positive, such as the price of a policy (price is always &gt; 0), or the claim costs, then these are good choices; If \\(Y\\) is binary, the the binomial response with either a Probit or Logit link. The Logit is more common. If \\(Y\\) has more than two categories, the multinomial distribution with either the Probit or Logic link. The exam will always ask you to interpret the GLM. These questions can usually be answered by inverting the link function and interpreting the coefficients. In the case of the log link, simply take the exponent of the coefficients and each of these represents a “relativity” factor. \\[ log(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = e^{\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta}} \\] For a single observation \\(y_i\\), this is \\[ \\text{exp}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \\beta_p x_{ip}) = \\\\ e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1 x_{i1}}e^{\\beta_2 x_{i2}} ... e^{\\beta_p x_{ip}} = R_o R_2 R_3 ... R_{p} \\] Where \\(R_k\\) is the relativity of the kth variable. This terminology is from insurance ratemaking, where actuaries need to be able to explain the impact of each variable in pricing insurance. The data science community does not use this language. For binary outcomes with logit or probit link, there is no easy interpretation. This has come up in at least one past sample exam, and the solution was to create “psuedo” observations and observe how changing each \\(x_k\\) would change the predicted value. Due to the time requirements, this is unlikely to come up on an exam. So if you are asked to use a logit or probit link, saying that the result is not easy to interpret should suffice. 8.3.1 Interactions An interaction occurs when the effect of a variable on the response is different depending on the level of other variables in the model. Consider this model: Let \\(x_2\\) be an indicator variable, which is 1 for some records and 0 otherwise. \\[\\hat{y_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2\\] There are now two different linear models dependong on whether x_1 is 0 or 1. $$ x_1 = 0 = _0 + _2 x_2 \\ x_1 = 1 = _0 + _1 + _2 x_2 + _3 x_2 \\ = (_0 + _1) + (_2 + _3 ) x_2 \\ = _0^* + _1^* x_2 $$ Notice how the intercept changes from \\(\\beta_0\\) to \\(\\beta_0^*\\) and the slope changes from \\(\\beta_1\\) to \\(\\beta_1^*\\). The SOA’s modules give an example with the using age and gender as below. This is not a very strong interaction, as the slopes are almost identical across gender. interactions %&gt;% ggplot(aes(age, actual, color = gender)) + geom_line() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &quot;Age vs. Actual by Gender&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Interactions imply different slopes&quot;, caption= &quot;data: interactions&quot;) Figure 8.5: Example of weak interaction Here is a clearer example from the auto_claim data. The lines show the slope of a linear model, assuming that only BLUEBOOK and CAR_TYPE were predictors in the model. You can see that the slope for Sedans and Sports Cars is higher than for Vans and Panel Trucks. auto_claim %&gt;% ggplot(aes(log(CLM_AMT), log(BLUEBOOK), color = CAR_TYPE)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &quot;Kelly Bluebook Value vs Claim Amount&quot;) ## Warning: Removed 7556 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). Figure 8.6: Example of strong interaction Any time that the effect that one variable has on the response is different depending on the value of other variables we say that there is an interaction. We can also use an hypothesis test with a GLM to check this. Simply include an interaction term and see if the coefficient is zero at the desired significance level. 8.3.2 Poisson Regression When the dependent variable is a count, such as the number of claims per month, Poisson regression is appropriate. This requires that each claim is independent in that one claim will not make another claim more or less likely. This means that the target variable is actually a rate, \\(\\frac{\\text{claims}}{\\text{months}}\\). More generally, we call the months the exposure. Let \\(m_i\\) by the units of exposure and \\(y_i\\) the target. We use a log-link function to correct for skewness. $$ log() = _0 + _1 x_1 + … + _p x_p \\ log() = log(m_i) + _0 + _1 x_1 + … + _p x_p $$ We call the \\(log(m_i)\\) the offset term. Notice that there is no coefficient (beta) on this value, because we already know what the impact will be. In R, the code for this equation would be glm(y ~ offset(log(m)) + x, family=poisson(link=log) ) Readings CAS Monograph 5 Chapter 2 ISLR 2.2 Assessing model accuracy 8.3.3 Advantages and disadvantages There is usually at least one question on the PA exam which asks you to “list some of the advantages and disadvantages of using this particular model”, and so here is one such list. GLM Advantages Easy to interpret Handles skewed data through different response distributions Models the average response which leads to stable predictions on new data Handles continuous and categorical data Works well on small data sets GLM Disadvantages Does not select features Strict assumptions around distribution shape, randomness of error terms, and others Unable to detect non-linearity directly (although this can manually be addressed through feature engineering) Sensitive to outliers Low predictive power 8.4 Penalized Linear Models One of the main weaknesses of the GLM is that the features need to be selected by hand. For large \\(p\\), this means that the modeler needs to test every combination of variables. This is time consuming. Earlier on we said that the linear model minimizes the sum of square terms, known as the residual sum of squares (RSS) \\[ \\text{RSS} = \\sum_i(y_i - \\hat{y})^2 = \\sum_i(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j = 1}^p\\beta_j x_{ij})^2 \\] This loss function can be modified so that models which include more (and larger) coefficients are considered as worse. In other words, when there are more \\(\\beta\\)’s, or \\(\\beta\\)’s which are larger, the RSS is higher. 8.4.1 Ridge Regression Ridge regression adds a penalty term which is proportional to the square of the sum of the coefficients. This is known as the “L2” norm. \\[ \\sum_i(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j = 1}^p\\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j = 1}^p\\beta_j^2 \\] This \\(\\lambda\\) controls how much of a penalty is imposed on the size of the coefficients. When \\(\\lambda\\) is high, simpler models are treated more favorably because the \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^p\\beta_j^2\\) carries more weight. Conversely, then \\(\\lambda\\) is low, complex models are more favored. When \\(\\lambda = 0\\), we have an ordinary GLM. 8.4.2 Lasso The official name is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, but the common name is just “the lasso”. Just as with Ridge regression, we want to favor simpler models; however, we also want to select variables. This is the same as forcing some coefficients to be equal to 0. Instead of taking the square of the coefficients (L2 norm), we take the absolute value (L1 norm). \\[ \\sum_i(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j = 1}^p\\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j = 1}^p|\\beta_j| \\] In ISLR, Hastie et al show that this results in coefficients being forced to be exactly 0. This is extremely useful because it means that by changing \\(\\lambda\\), we can select how many variables to use in the model. Note: While any response family is possible with penalized regression, in R, only the Gaussian family is possible in the library glmnet, and so this is the only type of question that the SOA can ask. 8.4.3 Advantages and disadvantages Elastic Net/Lasso/Ridge Advantages All benefits from GLMS Automatic variable selection Better predictive power than GLM (usually) Elastic Net/Lasso/Ridge Disadvantages All cons of GLMs Readings ISLR 6.1 Subset Selection ISLR 6.2 Shrinkage Methods "],
["tree-based-models.html", "Chapter 9 Tree-based models 9.1 Decision Trees 9.2 Advantages and disadvantages 9.3 Random Forests 9.4 Gradient Boosted Trees", " Chapter 9 Tree-based models 9.1 Decision Trees Decision trees can be used for either classification or regression problems. The model structure is a series of yes/no questions. Depending on how each observation answers these questions, a prediction is made. The below example shows how a single tree can predict health claims. For non-smokers, the predicted annual claims are 8,434. This represents 80% of the observations For smokers with a bmi of less than 30, the predicted annual claims are 21,000. 10% of patients fall into this bucket. For smokers with a bmi of more than 30, the prediction is 42,000. This bucket accounts for 11% of patients. Figure 9.1: Decision tree of health costs We can cut the data set up into these groups and look at the claim costs. From this grouping, we can see that smoker is the most important variable as the difference in average claims is about 20,000. smoker bmi_30 mean_claims percent no bmi &lt; 30 $7,977.03 0.38 no bmi &gt;= 30 $8,842.69 0.42 yes bmi &lt; 30 $21,363.22 0.10 yes bmi &gt;= 30 $41,557.99 0.11 This was a very simple example because there were only two variables. If we have more variables, the tree will get large very quickly. This will result in overfitting; there will be good performance on the training data but poor performance on the test data. The step-by-step process of building a tree is Step 1: Choose a variable at random. This could be any variable in age, children, charges, sex, smoker, age_bucket, bmi, or region. Step 2: Find the split point which best seperates observations out based on the value of \\(y\\). A good split is one where the \\(y\\)’s are very different. * In this case, smoker was chosen. Then we can only split this in one way: smoker = 1 or smoker = 0. Then for each of these groups, smokers and non-smokers, choose another variable at random. In this case, for no-smokers, age was chosen. To find the best cut point of age, look at all possible age cut points from 18, 19, 20, 21, …, 64 and choose the one which best separates the data. There are three ways of deciding where to split Entropy (aka, information gain) Gini Classification error Of these, only the first two are commonly used. The exam is not going to ask you to calculate either of these. Just know that neither method will work better on all data sets, and so the best practice is to test both and compare the performance. Step 3: Continue doing this until a stopping criteria is reached. For example, the minimum number of observations is 5 or less. As you can see, this results in a very deep tree. tree &lt;- rpart(formula = charges ~ ., data = health_insurance, control = rpart.control(cp = 0.003)) rpart.plot(tree, type = 3) Step 4: Apply cost comlexity pruning to simplify the tree Intuitively, we know that the above model would perform poorly due to overfitting. We want to make it simpler by removing nodes. This is very similar to how in linear models we reduce complexity by reducing the number of coefficients. A measure of the depth of the tree is the complexity. You can think of \\(|T|\\) as the “degrees of freedom” in a linear model. In the above example, \\(|T| = 8\\). The amount of penalization is controlled by \\(\\alpha\\). This is very similar to \\(\\lambda\\) in the Lasso. To calculate the cost of a tree, number the terminal nodes from \\(1\\) to \\(|T|\\), and let the set of observations that fall into the \\(mth\\) bucket be \\(R_m\\). Then add up the squared error over all terminal nodes to the penalty term. \\[ \\text{Cost}_\\alpha(T) = \\sum_{m=1}^{|T|} \\sum_{R_m}(y_i - \\hat{y}_{Rm})^2 + \\alpha |T| \\] Step 5: Use cross-validation to select the best alpha The cost is controlled by the CP parameter. In the above example, did you notice the line rpart.control(cp = 0.003)? This is telling rpart to continue growing the tree until the CP reaches 0.003. At each subtree, we can measure the cost CP as well as the cross-validation error xerror. This is stored in the cptable library(kableExtra) library(tidyverse) tree &lt;- rpart(formula = charges ~ ., data = health_insurance, control = rpart.control(cp = 0.0001)) cost &lt;- tree$cptable %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% select(nsplit, CP, xerror) cost %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## nsplit CP xerror ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 0.620 1.00 ## 2 1 0.144 0.381 ## 3 2 0.0637 0.240 ## 4 3 0.00967 0.180 ## 5 4 0.00784 0.173 ## 6 5 0.00712 0.170 As more splits are added, the cost continues to decrease, reaches a minimum, and then begins to increase. To optimize performance, choose the number of splits which has the lowest error. Often, though, the goal of using a decision tree is to create a simple model. In this case, we can err or the side of a lower nsplit so that the tree is shorter and more interpretable. All of the questions on so far have only used decision trees for interpretability, and a different model method has been used when predictive power is needed. You will typically be given the below code, which does this automatically. To get full credit on decision tree questions, mention that you used cross-validation to select the number of splits. pruned_tree &lt;- prune(tree,cp = tree$cptable[which.min(tree$cptable[, &quot;xerror&quot;]), &quot;CP&quot;]) 9.2 Advantages and disadvantages Advantages Easy to interpret Captures interaction effects Captures non-linearities Handles continuous and categorical data Handles missing values Disadvantages Is a “weak learner” because of low predictive power Does not work on small data sets Is often a simplification of the underlying process because all observations at terminal nodes have equal predicted values Is biased towards selecting high-cardinality features because more possible split points for these features tend to lead to overfitting High variance (which can be alleviated with stricter parameters) leads the “easy to interpret results” to change upon retraining Unable to predict beyond the range of the training data for regression (because each predicted value is an average of training samples) Readings ISLR 8.1.1 Basics of Decision Trees ISLR 8.1.2 Classification Trees rpart Documentation (Optional) 9.3 Random Forests Advantages Resilient to overfitting due to bagging Only one parameter to tune (mtry, the number of features considered at each split) Very good a multi-class prediction Nonlinearities Interaction effects Deal with unbalanced and missing data*Usually requires over/undersamplin Disadvantages Does not work on small data sets Weaker performance than other methods (GBM, NN) Unable to predict beyond training data for regression Readings ISLR 8.1.1 Basics of Decision Trees ISLR 8.1.2 Classification Trees 9.4 Gradient Boosted Trees High prediction accuracy Closest model to a “silver bullet” that exists Nonlinearities, interaction effects, resilient to outliers, corrects for missing values Deals with class imbalance directly through by weighting observations Disadvantages Requires large sample size Longer training time Does not detect linear combinations of features.
