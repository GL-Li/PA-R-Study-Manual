# Market	

Students studying for the CAS Modern Actuarial Statistics (MAS) exams and SOA students studying for the Predictive Analytics (PA) exam.	

There were 664 students who passed the June PA exam.  With a pass rate of 40% this means that about 1,660 students took the exam.  This is offered every 6 months.  	

# Sales Channels	

1) Coaching Actuaries https://www.coachingactuaries.com/	

I have a contact here from a research project that I completed in college.  	

2) Actex https://www.actexmadriver.com/	

You mentioned Actex.  	

3) TheInfiniteActuary https://www.theinfiniteactuary.com/	

I started using their MAS-I study manual.  They include a few (poorly coded) .rmd files already.  Video lectures and formula sheets, with practice problems online is their product.	

# Writing Style	

I’m inspired by this book, which is already enormously successful and is an Amazon best seller.

I like your idea of using R bookdown.  As you know, Hadley Wickham’s style of writing is great for learning code, which is what a lot of the current Actuarial Study manuals are missing.
