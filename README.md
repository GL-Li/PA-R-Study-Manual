Students studying for the CAS Modern Actuarial Statistics (MAS) exams and SOA students studying for the Predictive Analytics (PA) exam.

There were 664 students who passed the June PA exam.  With a pass rate of 40% this means that about 1,660 students took the exam.  This is offered every 6 months.
