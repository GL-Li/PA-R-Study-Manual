# Who is this book for

This book will help you to pass the SOA's Predictive Analytics Exam and give you insights and useful code snippets that will translate into your every day work flow.  Additionally, material is also covered which is on the CAS exams MAS-I and MAS-II.

# How to Use this book

This is like any of the other actuarial exam that you have taken.  The format is a 5-hr and 15 minute project that uses RStudio, Excel, and Word.  There are three essential skills needed to pass.  These are

1. R competency;
2. Business writing ability;
3. Statistics, predictive analytics, and machine learning knowledge.

If you already have some of these skills, then a good strategy is to focus on your weak areas.  If you are relatively new to all three, great!  This means that you will be able to learn a lot of useful skills by reading this manual.
