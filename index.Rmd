# Welcome

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}

This book covers the source material for the SOA's Predictive Analytics Exam.

<br>

**Features**

- All data sets used are packaged in a single R library
- Reproducible R code
- Explanations of the statistical concepts
- Tips on taking the exam
- Two **original** practice exams (coming soon)

# The Exam

You will have 5 hours and 15 minutes to use RStudio and Excel to fill out a report in Word on a Prometric computer.  The syllabus uses fancy language to describe the topics covered on the exam, making it sound more difficult than it should be.  A good analogy is a job description that has many complex-sounding tasks, when in reality the day-to-day operations of the employee are far simpler.

A non-technical translation is as follows:

**Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%)**

- Write in professional language
- Type more than 50 words-per-minute

**Manipulating Data in R (15-25%)**

- Quickly clean data sets
- Find data errors planted by the SOA
- Perform queries (aggregations, summaries, transformations)

**Machine learning and statistics (40-50%)**

- Build models
- Interpret results within a business context

# Learning

All of use are already familiar with how to learn - by improving from our mistakes.  By repeating what is successful and avoiding what results in failure, we learn by doing, by experience, or trial-and-error.  Machines learn in a similar way.

Take for example the process of studying for an exam.  Some study methods work well, but other methods do not.  The "data" are the practice problems, and the “label” is the answer (A,B,C,D,E).  We want to build a mental "model” that reads the question and predicts the answer.

We all know that memorizing answers without understanding concepts is ineffective, and statistics calls this "overfitting".  Conversely, not learning enough of the details and only learning the high-level concepts is "underfitting".

The more practice problems that we do, the larger the training data set, and the better the prediction.  When we see new problems, ones which have not appeared in the practice exams, we often have a difficult time. Quizing ourselves on realistic questions estimates our preparedness, and this is identical to a process known as "holdout testing" or "cross-validation". 

We can clearly state our objective: get as many correct answers as possible! We want to correctly predict the solution to every problem.  Said another way, we are trying to minimize the error, known as the "loss function".  

Different study methods work well for different people.  Some cover material quickly and others slowly absorb every detail.  A model has many "parameters" such as the "learning rate".  The only way to know which parameters are best is to test them on real data, known as "training".
