# Welcome
***

This book prepares you for the SOA's Predictive Analytics (PA) Exam.  

**Note:** This book is still being written and this is only a preview.

Many candidates start with prior knowledge about parts of this exam.  Very few are learning all of these topics for the first time. **This book allows you to skip the redundant sections and just focus on the new material.**  If you are new to this whole business of machine learning and R programming, great!  Every page will be useful.  

**Features**

- All data sets used are packaged in a single R library
- Clean, easy-to-read, efficient R code
- Explanations of the statistical concepts
- Tips on taking the exam
- Two **original** practice exams

# The Exam

You will have 5 hours and 15 minutes to use RStudio and Excel to fill out a report in Word on a Prometric computer.  The syllabus uses fancy language to describe the topics covered on the exam, making it sound more difficult than it should be.  A good analogy is a job description that has many complex-sounding tasks, when in reality the day-to-day operations of the employee are far simpler.

A non-technical translation is as follows:

**Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%)**

- Write in professional language
- Type more than 50 words-per-minute

**Manipulating Data in R (15-25%)**

- Quickly clean data sets
- Find data errors planted by the SOA
- Perform queries (aggregations, summaries, transformations)

**Making decisions based on machine learning and statistics knowledge (40-50%)**

- Understand several algorithms from a high level and be able to interpret and explain results in english
- Read R documentation about models and use this to make decisions

# What is machine learning? 

All of use are already familiar with how to learn - by improving from our mistakes.  By repeating what is successful and avoiding what results in failure, we learn by doing, by experience, or trial-and-error.  Machines learn in a similar way.

Take for example the process of studying for an exam.  Some study methods work well, but other methods do not.  We all know that memorizing answers without understanding concepts is an ineffective method, and that by quizing ourselves on realistic questions we can learn fastest.  Later, when we walk about cross-validation, we will see that computers do just this.

We can clearly state our objective: get as many correct answers as possible! We want to correctly predict the solution to every problem.  Said another way, we are trying to minimize the error, the percentage of incorrect problems.  If instead we measure progress based on a different metric, say hours studied for instance, we will be incentivized to waste time instead of doing work.  We will see that choosing a model's loss function performs the same action.

The "data" are the practice problems, and the “label” is the answer (A,B,C,D,E).  We want to build a “mental model” that reads the question and predicts the answer.  The SOA suggests 100 hours per hour of exam, which means that actuaries train on hundreds of problems before the real exam.  The more practice problems that we do, the larger the training data set, and the better our "mental model" becomes.  When we see new problems, ones which have not appeared in the practice exams, we often have a difficult time. But unlike computers, we don't have the ability to use parallel cores, to run continuously for hours on end, and have limited memory.  This means that we also need to study *strategically*, which is what this book will help with.
