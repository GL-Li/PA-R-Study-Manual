# Welcome

This book will help you to pass the SOA's Predictive Analytics (PA) Exam.  The structure is like a buffet in that you can eat whatever you choose: if you are in a rush, you can skip to the practice exams at the end; if you are looking to learn R programming, you can read the chapters on R; if you want to learn machine learning, you can read the chapters on ML.

After passing this exam with about 80 study hours, I realized that much of the material I had already learned from work experience in predictive modeling, kaggle, stats courses, from already reading the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", and from knowledge of R programming.  **This book allows you to skip the redundant sections and just focus on the new material.**  If you are new to this whole business of machine learning and R programming, great!  Every page will be useful.  


# The Exam

You will have 5 hours and 15 minutes to use RStudio and Excel to fill out a report in Word on a Prometric computer.  The topics from the SOA's syllabus are as follows.

https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2019/2019-12-exam-pa-syllabus.pdf

**Communication (30-40%)**
- Executive summary – clearly and concisely written summary that is appropriate for someone
who reads nothing else
- Problem statement – clearly defines the problem and its business context
- Use of tables and graphs – clearly constructed, labeled, and referenced
- Interpretation of model results – relates the results of the modeling process to the problem
statement
- Audience – sections tailored to the audience as described in the project statement
- Code – easy to follow, using intuitive variable names and sufficient comments

**Data Exploration and Feature Selection (15-25%)**
- Description of the data – summary statistics and graphs with interpretation
- Identification of issues and corrective steps – includes handling missing data and possible
transformations
- Selection of features for use in the model – includes creating new features through
transformations, clustering, or principal component analysis as appropriate.
- Code – successfully runs and produces output presented in the report

**Model Selection and Construction (40-50%)**
- Selection and justification of model type – relates model choice to the business problem and
the available data
- Estimation of model parameters and hyperparameters, with explanation – calibrates the
selected model, including selecting features from the list previously established
- Validation of the selected model – documents that an appropriate validation method was used
and provides an estimate of model accuracy using previously unseen data
- Description of selected model – describes the model in appropriate terms for the stated
audience
- Code – successfully runs and produces output presented in the report

A non-technical translation is as follows:

**Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%)**

Write in professional language and type more than 50 words-per-minute.

**Manipulating Data in R (15-25%)**

Quickly clean data sets, check for errors, and perform basic aggregations.

**Making decisions based on machine learning and statistics knowledge (40-50%)**

Understand several algorithms from a high level and be able to interpret and explain results in english.
