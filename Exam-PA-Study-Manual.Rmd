# Welcome
***

This book prepares you for the SOA's Predictive Analytics (PA) Exam.  

**Note:** This book is still being written and this is only a preview.

Many candidates start with prior knowledge about parts of this exam.  Very few are learning all of these topics for the first time. **This book allows you to skip the redundant sections and just focus on the new material.**  If you are new to this whole business of machine learning and R programming, great!  Every page will be useful.  

**Features**

- All data sets used are packaged in a single R library
- Clean, easy-to-read, efficient R code
- Explanations of the statistical concepts
- Tips on taking the exam
- Two **original** practice exams

# The Exam

You will have 5 hours and 15 minutes to use RStudio and Excel to fill out a report in Word on a Prometric computer.  The syllabus uses fancy language to describe the topics covered on the exam, making it sound more difficult than it should be.  A good analogy is a job description that has many complex-sounding tasks, when in reality the day-to-day operations of the employee are far simpler.

https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2019/2019-12-exam-pa-syllabus.pdf

A non-technical translation is as follows:

**Writing in Microsoft Word (30-40%)**

- Write in professional language
- Type more than 50 words-per-minute

**Manipulating Data in R (15-25%)**

- Quickly clean data sets
- Find data errors planted by the SOA
- Perform queries (aggregations, summaries, transformations)

**Making decisions based on machine learning and statistics knowledge (40-50%)**

- Understand several algorithms from a high level and be able to interpret and explain results in english
- Read R documentation about models and use this to make decisions

# What is machine learning? 

All of use are already familiar with how to learn - by improving from our mistakes.  By repeating what is successful and avoiding what results in failure, we learn by doing, by experience, or trial-and-error.  Machines learn in a similar way.

Take for example the process of studying for an exam.  Some study methods work well, but other methods do not.  We all know that memorizing answers without understanding concepts is an ineffective method, and that by quizing ourselves on realistic questions we can learn fastest.  Later, when we walk about cross-validation, we will see that computers do just this.

We can clearly state our objective: get as many correct answers as possible! We want to correctly predict the solution to every problem.  Said another way, we are trying to minimize the error, the percentage of incorrect problems.  If instead we measure progress based on a different metric, say hours studied for instance, we will be incentivized to waste time instead of doing work.  We will see that choosing a model's loss function performs the same action.

The "data" are the practice problems, and the “label” is the answer (A,B,C,D,E).  We want to build a “mental model” that reads the question and predicts the answer.  The SOA suggests 100 hours per hour of exam, which means that actuaries train on hundreds of problems before the real exam.  The more practice problems that we do, the larger the training data set, and the better our "mental model" becomes.  When we see new problems, ones which have not appeared in the practice exams, we often have a difficult time. But unlike computers, we don't have the ability to use parallel cores, to run continuously for hours on end, and have limited memory.  This means that we also need to study *strategically*, which is what this book will help with.

# Getting started 

This book is designed to get you set up within an hour.  If this is your first time using R, then you will need to install two pieces of software, R and RStudio.  Once these four steps have been done you should not need to download anything else needed for this book.  You will be able to work offline.

## Download ISLR

This book references the publically-avialable textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", which can be downloaded for free

http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/

## Installing R

This is the engine that *runs* the code.  https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

## Installing RStudio

This is the tool that helps you to *write* the code.  Just as MS Word creates documents, RStudio creates R scripts and other documents.  Download RStudio Desktop (the free edition) and choose a place on your computer to install it.

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Set the R library

R code is organized into libraries.  You want to use the exact same code that will be on the Prometric Computers.  This requires installing older versions of libraries.  Change your R library to the one which was included within the SOA's modules.

```{r eval = F}
.libPaths("PATH_TO_SOAS_LIBRARY/PAlibrary")
```

## Download the data

For your convenience, all data in this book, including data from prior exams and sample solutions, has been put into a library called `ExamPAData` by the author.  To access, simplly run the below lines of code to download this data.

```{r eval = F}
#check if devtools is installed and then install ExamPAData from github
if("devtools" %in% installed.packages()){
  library(devtools)
  install_github("https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData")
} else{
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  install_github("https://github.com/sdcastillo/ExamPAData")
}
```

Once this has run, you can access the data using `library(ExamPAData)`.  To check that this is installed correctly see if the `insurance` data set has loaded.  If this returns "object not found", then the library was not installed.

```{r}
library(ExamPAData)
summary(insurance)
```

# R programming

There are already many great R tutorials available.  To save time, this book will cover the absolute essentials.  The book "R for Data Science" provides one such introduction.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

## Notebook chunks

On the Exam, you will start with an .Rmd (R Markdown) template, which organize code into [R Notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html). Within each notebook, code is organized into chunks.  

```{r}
#this is a chunk
```

Your time is valuable.  Throughout this book, I will include useful keyboard shortcuts.

>**Shortcut:** To run everything in a chunk quickly, press `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`.  To create a new chunk, use `CTRL + ALT + I`.

## Basic operations

The usual math operations apply.

```{r}
#addition
1 + 2 
3 - 2

#multiplication
2*2

#division
4/2

#exponentiation
2^3
```

There are two assignment operators: `=` and `<-`.  The latter is preferred because it is specific to assigning a variable to a value.  The "=" operator is also used for assigning values in functions (see the functions section).  

>**Shortcut:** `ALT + -` creates a `<-`..

```{r}
#variable assignment
x = 2
y <- 2

#equality
4 == 2 #False
5 == 5 #true
3.14 > 3 #true
3.14 >= 3 #true
```

Vectors can be added just like numbers.  The `c` stands for "concatenate", which creates vectors.

```{r}
x <- c(1,2)
y <- c(3,4)
x + y
x*y

z <- x + y
z^2
z/2
z + 3
```

Lists are like vectors but can take any type of object type.  I already mentioned `numeric` types.  There are also `character` (string) types, `factor` types, and `boolean` types.

```{r}
character <- "The"
character_vector <- c("The", "Quick")
```

Characters are combined with the `paste` function.

```{r}
a = "The"
b = "Quick"
c = "Brown"
d = "Fox"
paste(a,b,c,d)
```

Factors are characters that expect only specific values.  A character can take on any value.  A factor is only allowed a finite number of values.  This reduces the memory size.

The below factor has only one "level", which is the list of assigned values.

```{r}
factor = as.factor(character)
levels(factor)
```

The levels of a factor are by default in R in alphabetical order (Q comes alphabetically before T).

```{r}
factor_vector <- as.factor(character_vector)
levels(factor_vector)
```

**In building linear models, the order of the factors matters.**  In GLMs, the "reference level" or "base level" should always be the level which has the most observations.  This will be covered in the section on linear models.

Booleans are just True and False values.  R understands `T` or `TRUE` in the same way.  When doing math, bools are converted to 0/1 values where 1 is equivalent to TRUE and 0 FALSE.

```{r}
bool_true <- T
bool_false <- F
bool_true*bool_false
```

Booleans are automatically converted into 0/1 values when there is a math operation.

```{r}
bool_true + 1
```

Vectors work in the same way.

```{r}
bool_vect <- c(T,T, F)
sum(bool_vect)
```

Vectors are indexed using `[]`.

```{r}
abc <- c("a", "b", "c")
abc[1]
abc[2]
abc[c(1,3)]
abc[c(1,2)]
abc[-2]
abc[-c(2,3)]
```


## Lists

Lists are vectors that can hold mixed object types.  Vectors need to be all of the same type.

```{r}
ls <- list(T, "Character", 3.14)
ls
```

Lists can be named.

```{r}
ls <- list(bool = T, character = "character", numeric = 3.14)
ls
```

The `$` operator indexes lists.

```{r}
ls$numeric

ls$numeric + 5
```

Lists can also be indexed using `[]`.

```{r}
ls[1]
ls[2]
```


Lists can contain vectors, other lists, and any other object.

```{r}
everything <- list(vector = c(1,2,3), character = c("a", "b", "c"), list = ls)
everything
```

To find out the type of an object, use `class` or `str` or `summary`.

```{r}
class(x)
class(everything)
str(everything)
summary(everything)
```


## Functions

You only need to understand the very basics of functions for this exam.  Still, understanding functions helps you to understand *everything* in R, since R is a functional [programming language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html), unlike Python, C, VBA, Java which are all object-oriented, or SQL which isn't really a language but a series of set-operations.

Functions do things.  The convention is to name a function as a verb.  The function `make_rainbows()` would create a rainbow.  The function `summarise_vectors` would summarise vectors.  Functions may or may not have an input and output.  

If you need to do something in R, there is a high probability that someone has already written a function to do it.  That being said, creating simple functions is quite useful.

**A function that does not return anything**

```{r}
greet_me <- function(my_name){
  print(paste0("Hello, ", my_name))
}

greet_me("Future Actuary")
```

**A function that returns something**

When returning something, the `return` statement is optional.

```{r}
add_together <- function(x, y){
  x + y
}

add_together(2,5)

add_together <- function(x, y){
  return(x + y)
}

add_together(2,5)
```

Functions can work with vectors.

```{r}
x_vector <- c(1,2,3)
y_vector <- c(4,5,6)
add_together(x_vector, y_vector)
```

Many functions in R actually return lists!  This is why R objects can be indexed with dollar sign.

```{r}
model <- lm(charges ~ age, data = health_insurance)
model$coefficients
```

Here's a function that returns a list.

```{r}
sum_multiply <- function(x,y){
  sum <- x + y
  product <- x*y
  list("Sum" = sum, "Product" = product)
}

result <- sum_multiply(2,3)
result$Sum
result$Product
```

## Data frames

R is an old programming language.  The original `data.frame` object has been updated with the newer and better `tibble` (like the word "table").  **Tibbles are really lists of vectors, where each column is a vector**.  

```{r}
library(tibble) #the tibble library has functions for making tibbles
data <- tibble(age = c(25, 35), has_fsa = c(F, T))
data
```

To index columns in a tibble, the same "$" is used as indexing a list.

```{r}
data$age
```

To find the number of rows and columns, use `dim`.

```{r}
dim(data)
```

To fine a summary, use `summary`

```{r}
summary(data)
```

## Pipes

The pipe operator `%>%` is a way of making code more readable and easier to edit. The way that we are taught to do functional composition is by nesting, which is slow to read and write.

In five seconds, tell me what the below code is doing.

```{r}
log(sqrt(exp(log2(sqrt((max(c(3, 4, 16))))))))
```

Did you get the answer of 1?  If so, you are good at reading parenthesis.  This requires starting from the inner-most nested brackets and moving outwards from right to left.

The math notation would be slightly easier to read, but still painful.

$$log(\sqrt{e^{log_2(\sqrt{max(3,4,16)})}})$$

Here is the same algebra using the pipe.  To read this, replace the `%>%` with the word `THEN`.

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(dplyr) #the pipe is from the dplyr library
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log2() %>% 
  exp() %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log()

#max(c(3, 4, 16) THEN   #The max of 3, 4, and 16 is 16
#  sqrt() THEN          #The square root of 16 is 4
#  log2() THEN          #The log in base 2 of 4 is 2
#  exp() THEN           #the exponent of 2 is e^2
#  sqrt() THEN          #the square root of e^2 is e
#  log()                #the natural logarithm of e is 1

```

You may not be convinced by this simple example using numbers; however, once we get to data manipulations in the next section the advantage of piping will become obvious.

To quickly produce pipes, use `CTRL + SHIFT + M`.  By highlighting only certain sections, we can run the code in steps as if we were using a debugger.  This makes testing out code much faster.

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16))
```

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() 
```

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log2() 
```

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log2() %>% 
  exp()
```

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log2() %>% 
  exp() %>% 
  sqrt() 
```

```{r}
max(c(3, 4, 16)) %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log2() %>% 
  exp() %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  log()
```

Those familiar with Python's Pandas will be see that `%>%` is quite similar to ".".

# Data manipulation

```{r echo = F, message = F}
library(kableExtra)
format_table <- function(data){data %>% kableExtra::kable("html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)}
```


About two hours in this exam will be spent just on data manipulation.  Putting in extra practice in this area is garanteed to give you a better score because it will free up time that you can use elsewhere.

Suggested reading of *R for Data Science* (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html):

All data for this book can be accessed from the package `ExamPAData`.  In the real exam, you will read the file from the Prometric computer.  To read files into R, the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/readr.html) package has several tools, one for each data format.  For instance, the most common format, comma separated values (csv) are read with the `read_csv()` function.

Because the data is already loaded, simply use the below code to access the data.

```{r}
library(ExamPAData)
```


## Look at the data

The data that we are using is `health_insurance`, which has information on patients and their health care costs.

The descriptions of the columns are below.  The technical name for this is a "data dictionary", and one will be provided to you on the real exam.

- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Sex
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children
- `smoker`: Is this person a smoker?
- `region`: Region
- `charges`: Annual health care costs.

`head()` shows the top n rows.  `head(20)` shows the top 20 rows.  

```{r message = F}
library(tidyverse)
head(health_insurance)
```

Using a pipe is an alternative way of doing this. Because this is more time-efficient, this will be the preferred method in this manual.  

```{r eval = F}
health_insurance %>% head()
```

>**Shortcut**: Use `CTRL` + `SHFT` + `M` to create pipes `%>%`

The `glimpse` function is a transpose of the `head()` function, which can be more spatially efficient.  This also gives you the dimension (1,338 rows, 7 columns).

```{r}
health_insurance %>% glimpse()
```

One of the most useful data science tools is counting things.  The function `count()` gives the number of records by a categorical feature.   

```{r}
health_insurance %>% count(children)
```

Two categories can be counted at once.  This creates a table with all combinations of `cut` and `color` and shows the number of records in each category.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% count(region, sex)
```

The `summary()` function is shows a statistical summary.  One caveat is that each column needs to be in it's appropriate type.  For example, `smoker`, `region`, and `sex` are all listed as characters when if they were factors, `summary` would give you count info.

**With incorrect data types**

```{r}
health_insurance %>% summary()
```

**With correct data types**

This tells you that there are 324 patients in the northeast, 325 in the northwest, 364 in the southeast, and so fourth.

```{r}
health_insurance <- health_insurance %>% 
  modify_if(is.character, as.factor)

health_insurance %>% 
  summary()
```

## Transform the data

Transforming, manipulating, querying, and wrangling are all words for the task of changing the values in a data frame. For those Excel users out there, this can be interpreted as "what Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and SUMIFF do". 

R syntax is designed to be similar to SQL.  They begin with a `SELECT`, use `GROUP BY` to aggregate, and have a `WHERE` to remove records.  Unlike SQL, the ordering of these does not matter.  `SELECT` can come after a `WHERE`.

**R to SQL translation**

```
select() -> SELECT
mutate() -> user-defined columns
summarize() -> aggregated columns
left_join() -> LEFT JOIN
filter() -> WHERE
group_by() -> GROUP BY
filter() -> HAVING
arrange() -> ORDER BY

```

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  select(age, region) %>% 
  head()
```

Tip: use `CTRL + SHIFT + M` to create pipes `%>%`.

Let's look at only those in the southeast region.  Instead of `WHERE`, use `filter`.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  filter(region == "southeast") %>% 
  select(age, region) %>% 
  head()
```

The SQL translation is

```{sql eval = F}
SELECT age, region
FROM health_insurance
WHERE region = 'southeast'
```


Instead of `ORDER BY`, use `arrange`.  Unlike SQL, the order does not matter and `ORDER BY` doesn't need to be last.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  select(age, region) %>% 
  head()
```

The `group_by` comes before the aggregation, unlike in SQL where the `GROUP BY` comes last.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age))
```

In SQL, this would be

```{sql eval = F}
SELECT region, 
       AVG(age) as avg_age
FROM health_insurance
GROUP BY region
```


Just like in SQL, many different aggregate functions can be used such as `SUM`, `MEAN`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and so forth.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age),
            max_age = max(age),
            median_charges = median(charges),
            bmi_std_dev = sd(bmi))
```

To create new columns, the `mutate` function is used.  For example, if we wanted a column of the person's annual charges divided by their age

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  mutate(charges_over_age = charges/age) %>% 
  select(age, charges, charges_over_age) %>% 
  head(5)
```

We can create as many new columns as we want.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  mutate(age_squared  = age^2,
         age_cubed = age^3,
         age_fourth = age^4) %>% 
  head(5)
```

The `CASE WHEN` function is quite similar to SQL.  For example, we can create a column which is `0` when `age < 50`, `1` when `50 <= age <= 70`, and `2` when `age > 70`.

```{r}
health_insurance %>% 
  mutate(age_bucket = case_when(age < 50 ~ 0,
                                age <= 70 ~ 1,
                                age > 70 ~ 2)) %>% 
  select(age, age_bucket)
```

SQL translation:

```{sql eval = F}
SELECT CASE WHEN AGE < 50 THEN 0
       ELSE WHEN AGE <= 70 THEN 1
       ELSE 2
FROM health_insurance
```

## Exercises

Run this code on your computer to answer these exercises.

The data `actuary_salaries` contains the salaries of actuaries collected from the DW Simpson survey.  Use this data to answer the exercises below.

```{r }
actuary_salaries %>% glimpse()
```

1.  How many industries are represented?
2.  The `salary_high` column is a character type when it should be numeric.  Change this column to numeric.
3.  What are the highest and lowest salaries for an actuary in Health with 5 exams passed?
4.  Create a new column called `salary_mid` which has the middle of the `salary_low` and `salary_high` columns.
5.  When grouping by industry, what is the highest `salary_mid`?  What about `salary_high`?  What is the lowest `salary_low`?
6.  There is a mistake when `salary_low == 11`.  Find and fix this mistake, and then rerun the code from the previous task.
7.  Create a new column, called `n_exams`, which is an integer.  Use 7 for ASA/ACAS and 10 for FSA/FCAS.  Use the code below as a starting point and fill in the `_` spaces

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(n_exams = case_when(exams == "FSA" ~ _,
                             exams == "ASA" ~ _,
                             exams == "FCAS" ~ _,
                             exams == "ACAS" ~ _,
                             TRUE ~ as.numeric(substr(exams,_,_)))) 
```

8. Create a column called `social_life`, which is equal to `n_exams`/`experience`.  What is the average (mean) `social_life` by industry?  Bonus question: what is wrong with using this as a statistical measure?


## Answers to exercises

1.  How many industries are represented?

```{r }
actuary_salaries %>% count(industry)
```

2.  The `salary_high` column is a character type when it should be numeric.  Change this column to numeric.

```{r}
#method 1
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% mutate(salary_high = as.numeric(salary_high))

#method 2
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% modify_at("salary_high", as.numeric)
```

3.  What are the highest and lowest salaries for an actuary in Health with 5 exams passed?

```{r }
actuary_salaries %>% 
  filter(industry == "Health", exams == 5) %>% 
  summarise(highest = max(salary_high),
            lowest = min(salary_low))
```


4.  Create a new column called `salary_mid` which has the middle of the `salary_low` and `salary_high` columns.

```{r  }
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(salary_mid = (salary_low + salary_high)/2)
```


5.  When grouping by industry, what is the highest `salary_mid`?  What about `salary_high`?  What is the lowest `salary_low`?

```{r  }
actuary_salaries %>% 
  group_by(industry) %>% 
  summarise(max_salary_mid = max(salary_mid),
            max_salary_high = max(salary_high),
            low_salary_low = min(salary_low))
```

6.  There is a mistake when `salary_low == 11`.  Find and fix this mistake, and then rerun the code from the previous task.

```{r }
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(salary_low = ifelse(salary_low == 11, yes = 114, no = salary_low),
         salary_high = ifelse(salary_high == 66, yes = 166, no = salary_high))

#the minimum salary low is now 48
actuary_salaries %>% 
  group_by(industry) %>% 
  summarise(max_salary_mid = max(salary_mid),
            max_salary_high = max(salary_high),
            low_salary_low = min(salary_low))
```

7.  Create a new column, called `n_exams`, which is an integer.  Use 7 for ASA/ACAS and 10 for FSA/FCAS.

Use the code below as a starting point and fill in the `_` spaces

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(n_exams = case_when(exams == "FSA" ~ _,
                             exams == "ASA" ~ _,
                             exams == "FCAS" ~ _,
                             exams == "ACAS" ~ _,
                             TRUE ~ as.numeric(substr(exams,_,_)))) 
```


```{r  }
actuary_salaries <- actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(n_exams = case_when(exams == "FSA" ~ 10,
                             exams == "ASA" ~ 7,
                             exams == "FCAS" ~ 10,
                             exams == "ACAS" ~ 7,
                             TRUE ~ as.numeric(substr(exams,1,2)))) 

actuary_salaries %>% count(n_exams)
```

8. Create a column called `social_life`, which is equal to `n_exams`/`experience`.  What is the average (mean) `social_life` by industry?  Bonus question: what is wrong with using this as a statistical measure?

```{r}
actuary_salaries %>% 
  mutate(social_life = n_exams/experience) %>% 
  group_by(industry) %>% 
  summarise(avg_social_life = mean(social_life))

#this is not REALLY an average as the number of people, or number of actuaries, are not taken into consideration.  To correctly take the average, we would need use a weighted average like sum(number_actuaries*social_life)/sum(number_actuaries)
```

# Visualization

The creator's of the exam do not expect candidates to be expert data scientists.  You will not be graded based on aesthetics; however, in order to interpret results it is necessary to understand the basics of how graphs are made.  

## Create a plot object (ggplot)

The first step is to create a blank canvas that holds the columns that are needed.  Let's say that the goal is to graph `income` and `count`.  We put these into a ggplot object called `p`.

The `aesthetic` argument, `aes`, means that the x-axis will have `income` and the y-axis will have `count`.

```{r}
p <- insurance %>% ggplot(aes(x = holders, y = claims))
```

If we look at `p`, we see that it is nothing but white space with axis for `count` and `income`.

```{r}
p
```

## Add a plot

We add an xy plot.

```{r}
p + geom_point()
```

We can also create a bar plot.

```{r}
p <- insurance %>% ggplot(aes(x = district, y = claims))
p + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Creating histograms is even easier.  Just specify the column that you want to graph as the x column.  No y is needed because a histogram is one-dimensional.  

Take a x to be a random variable from a gamma distribution.

```{r}
gamma = tibble(x = rgamma(1000, shape = 1, rate = 2))
```


```{r}
p <- gamma %>% ggplot(aes(x))
p + geom_histogram()
```

We can graph a density instead of a histogram by using `geom_density` instead of `geom_hist`.

```{r}
p + geom_density(fill = "grey")
```

# Introduction to Modeling

## Model Notation

The number of observations will be denoted by $n$.  When we refer to the size of a data set, we are referring to $n$.  We use $p$ to refer the number of input variables used.  The word "variables" is synonymous with "features".  For example, in the `health_insurance` data, the variables are `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker` and `region`.  These 7 variables mean that $p = 7$.  The data is collected from 1,338 patients, which means that $n = 1,338$.

Scalar numbers are denoted by ordinary variables (i.e., $x = 2$, $z = 4$), and vectors are denoted by bold-faced letters 

$$\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}$$

We use $\mathbf{y}$ to denote the target variable.  This is the variable which we are trying to predict.  This can be either a whole number, in which case we are performing *regression*, or a category, in which case we are performing *classification*.  In the health insurance example, `y = charges`, which are the annual health care costs for a patient.

Both $n$ and $p$ are important because they tell us what types of models are likely to work well, and which methods are likely to fail.  For the PA exam, we will be dealing with small $n$ (<100,000) due to the limitations of the Prometric computers.  We will use a small $p$ (< 20) in order to make the data sets easier to interpret.

We organize these variables into matrices.  Take an example with $p$ = 2 columns and 3 observations.  The matrix is said to be $3 \times 2$ (read as "2-by-3") matrix.

$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}x_{11} & x_{21}\\
x_{21} & x_{22}\\
x_{31} & x_{32}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The target is 

$$\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ y_3 \end{pmatrix}$$
This represents the *unknown* quantity that we want to be able to predict.  In the health care costs example, $y_1$ would be the costs of the first patient, $y_2$ the costs of the second patient, and so forth.  The variables $x_{11}$ and $x_{12}$ might represent the first patient's age and sex respectively, where $x_{i1}$ is the patient's age, and $x_{i2} = 1$ if the ith patient is male and 0 if female.

Machine learning is about using $\mathbf{X}$ to predict $\mathbf{y}$. We call this "y-hat", or simply the prediction.  This is based on a function of the data $X$.

$$\mathbf{\hat{y}} = f(\mathbf{X}) = \begin{pmatrix} \hat{y_1} \\ \hat{y_2} \\ \hat{y_3} \end{pmatrix}$$


This is almost never going to happen perfectly, and so there is always an error term, $\mathbf{\epsilon}$.  This can be made smaller, but is never exactly zero.  

$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} + \mathbf{\epsilon} = f(\mathbf{X}) + \mathbf{\epsilon}
$$

In other words, $\epsilon = y - \hat{y}$.  We call this the *residual*.  When we predict a person's health care costs, this is the difference between the predicted costs (which we had created the year before) and the actual costs that the patient experienced (of that current year).

## Ordinary least squares (OLS)

The type of model used refers to the class of function of $f$.  If $f$ is linear, then we are using a linear model.  If $f$ is non-parametric (does not have input parameters), then it is non-parametric modeling.  Linear models are linear in the parameters, $\beta$.

We have the data $\mathbf{X}$ and the target $\mathbf{y}$, where all of the y's are real numbers, or $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$.

We want to find a $\mathbf{\beta}$ so that 

$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}
$$

Which means that each $y_i$ is a linear combination of the variables $x_1, ..., x_p$, plus a constant $\beta_0$ which is called the *intercept* term.  

$$
\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p
\end{equation}
$$

In the one-dimensional case, this creates a line connecting the points.  In higher dimensions, this creates a hyperplane.

```{r message = F, echo = F,caption = "Linear Regression for 1-dimensional model"}
library(tidyverse)
tibble(y = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
       x = y + 0.4*rnorm(10,0, 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_point( show.legend = F) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, aes(fill = "linear regression"), color = "red", show.legend = T) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_fill_manual(name="legend", values=c("blue", "red")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


The question then is **how can we choose the best values of** $\beta?$  First of all, we need to define what we mean by "best".  Ideally, we will choose these values which will create close predictions of $\mathbf{y}$ on new, unseen data.  
To solve for $\mathbf{\beta}$, we first need to define a *loss function*.  This allows us to compare how well a model is fitting the data.  The most commonly used loss function is the residual sum of squares (RSS), also called the *squared error loss* or the L2 norm.  When RSS is small, then the predictions are close to the actual values and the model is a good fit.  When RSS is large, the model is a poor fit.

$$
\text{RSS} = \sum_i(y_i - \hat{y})^2
$$

When you replace $\hat{y_i}$ in the above equation with $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p$, take the derivative with respect to $\beta$, set equal to zero, and solve, we can find the optimal values.  This turns the problem of statistics into a problem of numeric optimization, which computers can do quickly.

You might be asking: why does this need to be the squared error?  Why not the absolute error, or the cubed error?  Technically, these could be used as well.  In fact, the absolute error (L1 norm) is useful in other models.  Taking the square has a number of advantages.  

- It provides the same solution if we assume that the distribution of $\mathbf{Y}|\mathbf{X}$ is guassian and maximize the likelihood function.  This method is used for GLMs, in the next chapter.
- Empirically it has been shown to be less likely to overfit as compared to other loss functions

## Example

In our health, we can create a linear model using `bmi`, `age`, and `sex` as an inputs.  

The `formula` controls which variables are included.  There are a few shortcuts for using R formulas.  

| Formula | Meaning  | 
|-------|---------|
| `charges` ~ `bmi` + `age` | Use `age` and `bmi` to predict `charges` |
| `charges` ~ `bmi` + `age` + `bmi`*`age` | Use `age`,`bmi` as well as an interaction to predict `charges` |
| `charges` ~ (`bmi > 20`) + `age` | Use an indicator variable for `bmi > 20` `age` to predict `charges` |
| log(`charges`) ~ log(`bmi`) + log(`age`) | Use the logs of `age` and `bmi` to predict  log(`charges`) |
| `charges` ~ . | Use all variables to predict `charges`|

You can use formulas to create new variables (aka feature engineering).  This can save you from needing to re-run code to create data.  

Below we fit a simple linear model to predict charges.

```{r message = F}
library(ExamPAData)
library(tidyverse)

model <- lm(data = health_insurance, formula = charges ~ bmi + age)
```

The `summary` function gives details about the model.  First, the `Estimate`, gives you the coefficients.  The `Std. Error` is the error of the estimate for the coefficient.  Higher standard error means greater uncertainty.  This is relative to the average value of that variable.  The `t value` tells you how "big" this error really is based on standard deviations.  A larger `t value` implies a low probability of the null hypothesis being rejected saying that the coefficient is zero.  This is the same as having a p-value (`Pr (>|t|))`) being close to zero.

The little `*`, `**`, `***` indicate that the variable is either somewhat significant, significant, or highly significant.  "significance" here means that there is a low probability of the coefficient being that size if there were *no actual casual relationship*, or if the data was random noise.

```{r}
summary(model)
```

When evaluating model performance, you should not rely on the `summary` alone as this is based on the training data.  To look at performance, test the model on validation data.  This can be done by a) using a hold out set, or b) using cross-validation, which is even better.

Let's create an 80% training set and 20% testing set.  You don't need to worry about understanding this code as the exam will always give this to you.

```{r message = F}
library(caret)
#create a train/test split
index <- createDataPartition(y = health_insurance$charges, p = 0.8, list = F) %>% as.numeric()
train <-  health_insurance %>% slice(index)
test <- health_insurance %>% slice(-index)
```

Train the model on the `train` and test on `test`.  

```{r}
model <- lm(data = train, formula = charges ~ bmi + age)
pred = predict(model, test)
```

Let's look at the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  

```{r}
get_rmse <- function(y, y_hat){
  sqrt(mean((y - y_hat)^2))
}

get_rmse(pred, test$charges)
```

The above number does not tell us if this is a good model or not by itself.  We need a comparison.  The fastest check is to compare against a prediction of the mean.  In other words, all values of the `y_hat` are the average of `charges`

```{r}
get_rmse(mean(test$charges), test$charges)
```

The RMSE is **higher** (worse) when using just the mean, which is what we expect.  **If you ever fit a model and get an error which is worse than the average prediction, something must be wrong.**

The next test is to see if any assumptions have been violated.  

First, is there a pattern in the residuals?  If there is, this means that the model is missing key information.  For the model below, this is a **yes**, which means that this is a bad model.  Because this is just for illustration, I'm going to continue using it, however.  

```{r fig.cap="Residuals vs. Fitted"}
plot(model, which = 1)
```

The normal QQ shows how well the quantiles of the predictions fit to a theoretical normal distribution.  If this is true, then the graph is a straight 45-degree line.  In this model, you can definitely see that this is not the case.  If this were a good model, this distribution would be closer to normal.

```{r fig.cap="Normal Q-Q"}
plot(model, which = 2)
```

**Caution: This test only applies to linear models which have a gaussian response distribution.**

The below is from an excellent post of Stack Exchange.

>R does not have a distinct plot.glm() method. When you fit a model with glm() and run plot(), it calls ?plot.lm, which is appropriate for linear models (i.e., with a normally distributed error term).

>More specifically, the plots will often 'look funny' and lead people to believe that there is something wrong with the model when it is perfectly fine. We can see this by looking at those plots with a couple of simple simulations where we know the model is correct:

Once you have chosen your model, you should re-train over the entire data set.  This is to make the coefficients more stable because `n` is larger.  Below you can see that the standard error is lower after training over the entire data set.

```{r }
model_full_data <- lm(data = health_insurance, formula = charges ~ bmi + age)
model_test_data <-  lm(data = train, formula = charges ~ bmi + age)
```

```{r fig.cap="Coefficient Standard Error on Test vs. All Data", echo = F, message=F}
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)
model_full_data %>% tidy() %>% 
  select(term, std.error) %>% 
  left_join(model_test_data %>% tidy() %>% select(term, std.error), by = "term") %>% 
  rename(full_data_std_error = std.error.x, test_data_std_error = std.error.y) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(.x, 1)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable("html")
```

All interpretations should be based on the model which was trained on the entire data set.  Obviously, this only makes a difference if you are interpreting the precise values of the coefficients.  If you are just looking at which variables are included, or at the size and sign of the coefficients, then this would not change.

```{r}
coefficients(model_full_data)
```

Translating the above into an equation we have

$$\hat{y_i} = -6,424.80 + 332.97 \space\text{bmi} + 241.93\space \text{age}$$

For example, if a patient has `bmi = 27.9` and `age = 19` then predicted value is 

$$\hat{y_1} = -6,424.80 + (332.97)(27.9) + (241.93)(19) = 7,461.73$$

This model structure implies that each of the variables $\mathbf{x_1}, ..., \mathbf{x_p}$ each change the predicted $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$.  If $x_{ij}$ increases by one unit, then $y_i$ increases by $\beta_j$ units, regardless of what happens to all of the other variables.  This is one of the main assumptions of linear models: *variable indepdendence*.  If the variables are correlated, say, then this assumption will be violated.

# Generalized linear models (GLMs)

## Model form

Instead of the model being a direct linear combination of the variables, there is an intermediate step called a *link function* $g$.

$$
g(\mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}
$$

This implies that the response $\mathbf{y}$ is related to the linear predictor $\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}$ through the *inverse* link function.

$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = g^-1(\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta})
$$

This means that $g(.)$ must be an invertable.  For example, if $g$ is the natural logarithm (aka, the "log-link"), then

$$
log(\mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta} \Rightarrow \mathbf{\hat{y}} = e^{\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}}
$$

This is useful when the distribution of $Y$ is skewed, as taking the log corrects skewness.

```{r echo = F,message = F, fig.cap="Taking the log corrects for skewness"}
tibble(y = exp(rnorm(1000))) %>% 
  mutate(log_y = log(y)) %>% 
  gather(stat, value) %>% 
  mutate(stat = ifelse(stat == "y", "Before Log Transform", "After Log Transform") %>% 
           fct_relevel(c("Before Log Transform", "After Log Transform"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(stat), scales = "free") + 
  theme_bw()
```

You might be asking, what if the distribution of $Y$ is not normal, no matter what choice we have for $g$?  The short answer is that we can change our assumption of the distribution of $Y$, and use this to change the parameters.  If you have taken exam STAM then you are familiar with *maximum likelihood estimation*.  

We have a response $\mathbf{Y}$, and we fit a distribution to $\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X}$.  This is the target variable conditioned on the data.  For each $y_i$, each observation, we assign a probability $f_Y(y_i)$

$$
f_y(y_i | X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ..., X_p = x_p) = Pr(Y = y_i | \mathbf{X})
$$

Now, when we choose the response family, we are simply changing $f_Y$.  If we say that the response family is Gaussian, then $f$ has a Gaussian PDF.  If we are modeling counts, then $f$ is a Poisson PDF.  This only works if $f$ is in the *exponential family* of distributions, which consists of the common names such as Gaussian, Binomial, Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and so forth.  Reading the CAS Monograph 5 will provide more detail into this.

The possible combinations of link functions and distribution families are summarized nicely on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model#Link_function).

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Distribution-Link Function Combinations"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/glm_links.png")
```

For this exam, a common question is to ask candiates to choose the best distribution and link function.  There is no all-encompasing answer, but a few suggestions are

- If $Y$ is counting something, such as the number of claims, number of accidents, or some other discrete and positive counting sequence, use the Poisson;
- If $Y$ contains negative values, then do not use the Exponential, Gamma, or Inverse Gaussian as these are strictly positive.  Conversely, if $Y$ is only positive, such as the price of a policy (price is always > 0), or the claim costs, then these are good choices;
- If $Y$ is binary, the the binomial response with either a Probit or Logit link.  The Logit is more common.
- If $Y$ has more than two categories, the multinomial distribution with either the Probit or Logic link (See Logistic Regression)

The exam will always ask you to interpret the GLM.  These questions can usually be answered by inverting the link function and interpreting the coefficients.  In the case of the log link, simply take the exponent of the coefficients and each of these represents a "relativity" factor.

$$
log(\mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta} \Rightarrow \mathbf{\hat{y}} = e^{\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}}
$$

For a single observation $y_i$, this is

$$
\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \beta_p x_{ip}) = \\
e^{\beta_0} e^{\beta_1 x_{i1}}e^{\beta_2 x_{i2}} ...  e^{\beta_p x_{ip}} = 
R_o R_2 R_3 ... R_{p}
$$

Where $R_k$ is the *relativity* of the kth variable.  This terminology is from insurance ratemaking, where actuaries need to be able to explain the impact of each variable in pricing insurance.  The data science community does not use this language. 

For binary outcomes with logit or probit link, there is no easy interpretation.  This has come up in at least one past sample exam, and the solution was to create "psuedo" observations and observe how changing each $x_k$ would change the predicted value.  Due to the time requirements, this is unlikely to come up on an exam.  So if you are asked to use a logit or probit link, saying that the result is not easy to interpret should suffice.

## Example

Just as with OLS, there is a `formula` and `data argument`.  In addition, we need to specify the response distribution and link function.

```{r}
model = glm(formula = charges ~ age + sex + children, 
            family = gaussian(link = "log"),
            data = health_insurance)
```

We see that `age`, `sex`, and `children` are all significant (p <0.01).  Reading off the coefficient signs, we see that claims

- Increase as age increases
- Are higher for men
- Are slightly higher for patients wich children

```{r}
model %>% tidy()
```

## Reference levels

When a categorical variable is used in a GLM, the model actually uses indicator variables for each level.  The default reference level is the order of the R factors.  For the `sex` variable, the order is `female` and then `male`.  This means that the base level is `female` by default.

```{r}
health_insurance$sex %>% as.factor() %>% levels()
```

Why does this matter?  Statistically, the coefficients are most stable when there are more observations.

```{r}
health_insurance$sex %>% as.factor() %>% summary()
```

There is already a function to do this in the `tidyverse` called `fct_infreq`.  Let's quickly fix the `sex` column so that these factor levels are in order of frequency.

```{r}
health_insurance <- health_insurance %>% 
  mutate(sex = fct_infreq(sex))
```

Now `male` is the base level.

```{r}
health_insurance$sex %>% as.factor() %>% levels()
```

## Interactions

An interaction occurs when the effect of a variable on the response is different depending on the level of other variables in the model.

Consider this model:

Let $x_2$ be an indicator variable, which is 1 for some records and 0 otherwise.  

$$\hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2$$

There are now two different linear models dependong on whether `x_1` is 0 or 1.

When $x_1 = 0$,

$$\hat{y_i} = \beta_0  + \beta_2 x_2$$

and when $x_1 = 1$

$$\hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_2$$
By rewriting this we can see that the intercept changes from $\beta_0$ to $\beta_0^*$ and the slope changes from $\beta_1$ to $\beta_1^*$

$$
(\beta_0 + \beta_1) + (\beta_2 + \beta_3 ) x_2 \\
 = \beta_0^* + \beta_1^* x_2
$$

The SOA's modules give an example with the using age and gender as below.  This is not a very strong interaction, as the slopes are almost identical across `gender`.

```{r warning = F,fig.cap="Example of weak interaction"}
interactions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, actual, color = gender)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Age vs. Actual by Gender", 
       subtitle = "Interactions imply different slopes",
       caption= "data: interactions")
```

Here is a clearer example from the `auto_claim` data. The lines show the slope of a linear model, assuming that only `BLUEBOOK` and `CAR_TYPE` were predictors in the model.  You can see that the slope for Sedans and Sports Cars is higher than for Vans and Panel Trucks.  

```{r fig.cap="Example of strong interaction"}
auto_claim %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(CLM_AMT), log(BLUEBOOK), color = CAR_TYPE)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + 
  theme_bw()  + 
  labs(title = "Kelly Bluebook Value vs Claim Amount")
```

Any time that the effect that one variable has on the response is different depending on the value of other variables we say that there is an interaction.  We can also use an hypothesis test with a GLM to check this.  Simply include an interaction term and see if the coefficient is zero at the desired significance level.

### Poisson Regression

When the dependent variable is a count, such as the number of claims per month, Poisson regression is appropriate.  This requires that each claim is independent in that one claim will not make another claim more or less likely.  This means that the target variable is actually a rate, $\frac{\text{claims}}{\text{months}}$.  More generally, we call the months the *exposure*.

Let $m_i$ by the units of exposure and $y_i$ the target.  We use a log-link function to correct for skewness.

$$ log(\frac{\hat{y_i}}{m_i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p$$

By using the fact that $log(\frac{a}{b}) = log(a) - log(b)$ this turns into

$$log(\hat{y_i}) = log(m_i) + \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p$$

We call the $log(m_i)$ the `offset` term.  Notice that there is no coefficient (beta) on this value, because we already know what the impact will be.  

In R, the code for this equation would be

```{r eval = F}
glm(y ~ offset(log(m)) + x, family=poisson(link=log) )
```

### Tweedie regression

While this topic is briefly mentioned on the modules, the only R libraries which support Tweedie Regression (`statmod` and `tweedie`) are not on the syllabus, and so there is no way that the SOA could ask you to build a tweedie model. This means that you can be safely skip this section.

### Stepwise subset selection

In theory, we could test all possible combinations of variables and interaction terms.  This includes all $p$ models with one predictor, all p-choose-2 models with two predictors, all p-choose-3 models with three predictors, and so forth.  Then we take whichever model has the best performance as the final model.

This "brute force" approach is statistically ineffective: the more variables which are searched, the higher the chance of finding models that overfit.

A subtler method, known as *stepwise selection*, reduces the chances of overfitting by only looking at the most promising models.  

**Forward Stepwise Selection:**

1. Start with no predictors in the model;
2. Evaluate all $p$ models which use only one predictor and choose the one with the best performance (highest $R^2$ or lowest $\text{RSS}$);
3. Repeat the process when adding one additional predictor, and continue until there is a model with one predictor, a model with two predictors, a model with three predictors, and so forth until there are $p$ models;
4. Select the single best model which has the best $\text{AIC}$,$\text{BIC}$, or adjusted $R^2$.

**Backward Stepwise Selection:**

1. Start with a model that contains all predictors;
2. Create a model which removes all predictors;
3. Choose the best model which removes all-but-one predictor;
4. Choose the best model which removes all-but-two predictors;
5. Continue until there are $p$ models;
6. Select the single best model which has the best $\text{AIC}$,$\text{BIC}$, or adjusted $R^2$.

**Both Forward & Backward Selection:**

ISLR does not mention this directly, however, a GLM using this method appeared on the 2019 June exam.  A post of Stack Overflow provides a good description:

`MASS::step()` with the option `direction = 'both'` works by comparing the AIC improvements from 
dropping each candidate variable, and adding each candidate variable between the upper and lower bound regressor sets supplied,
from the current model, and by dropping or adding the one variable that leads to the best AIC improvement (smallest AIC).

For example, assume that you are fitting a linear regression model with the upper set of variables $U = \{X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6, X_7\}$, and lower set $L = \{X_1\}$, and the starting object $S_0 = \{X_1, X_3\}$, then the potential sets of retained regressors might be something like

$$
\begin{align}
S_1 &= \{X_1, X_3, X_6\} &\text{  (add $X_6$)  }\\
S_2 &= \{X_1, X_3, X_6, X_4\} &\text{  (add $X_4$)  }\\
S_3 &= \{X_3, X_6, X_4\} &\text{  (drop $X_1$)  }\\
S_4 &= \{X_3, X_6, X_4, X_7\} &\text{  (add $X_7$)  }\\
S_5 &= \{X_3, X_4, X_7\} &\text{  (drop $X_6$)  }
\end{align}
$$

and so on, till no AIC improvements can be made.

>**Tip**: Always load the `MASS` library before `dplyr` or `tidyverse`.  Otherwise there will be conflicts as there are functions named `select()` and `filter()` in both.  Alternatively, specify the library in the function call with `dplyr::select()`.

### Advantages and disadvantages

There is usually at least one question on the PA exam which asks you to "list some of the advantages and disadvantages of using this particular model", and so here is one such list. 

**GLM Advantages**

- Easy to interpret
- Can easily be deployed in spreadsheet format
- Handles skewed data through different response distributions
- Models the average response which leads to stable predictions on new data
- Handles continuous and categorical data
- Works well on small data sets

**GLM Disadvantages**

- Does not select features (without stepwise selection)
- Strict assumptions around distribution shape, randomness of error terms, and variable correlations 
- Unable to detect non-linearity directly (although this can manually be addressed through feature engineering)
- Sensitive to outliers
- Low predictive power


# Logistic Regression

## Model form

Logistic regression is a special type of GLM.  The name is confusing because the objective is *classification* and not regression.  While most examples focus on binary classification, logistic regression also works for multiclass classification.

The model form is as before

$$g(\mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}$$

However, now the target $y_i$ is a category.  Our objective is to predict a probability of being in each category.  For regression, $\hat{y_i}$ can be any number, but now we need $0 \leq \hat{y_i} \leq 1$.

We can use a special link function, known as the *standard logistic function*, *sigmoid*, or *logit*, to force the output to be in this range of $\{0,1\}$.

$$\mathbf{\hat{y}} = g^{-1}(\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\beta}}}$$

```{r fig.cap="Standard Logistic Function", fig.height=4, fig.width=4, echo = F}
tibble(x = -6:6,y = 1/(1 + exp(6:-6))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_line(color = "red") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("x") + 
  ylab("g^-1(x)") 
```

Other link functions for classification problems are possible as well, although the logistic function is the most common.  If a problem asks for an alternative link, such as the *probit*, fit both models and compare the performance.

## Example

Using the `auto_claim` data, we predict whether or not a policy has a claim.  This is also known as the *claim frequency*.

```{r}
auto_claim %>% count(CLM_FLAG)
```

About 40% do not have a claim while 60% have at least one claim.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
index <- createDataPartition(y = auto_claim$CLM_FLAG, p = 0.8, list = F) %>% as.numeric()
auto_claim <- auto_claim %>% mutate(target = as.factor(ifelse(CLM_FLAG == "Yes", 1,0)))
train <-  auto_claim %>% slice(index)
test <- auto_claim %>% slice(-index)

frequency <- glm(target ~ AGE + GENDER + MARRIED + CAR_USE + BLUEBOOK + CAR_TYPE + AREA
             , data=train, 
             family = binomial(link="logit"))
```

All of the variables except for the `CAR_TYPE` are highly significant.  The car types `SPORTS CAR` and `SUV` appear to be significant, and so if we wanted to make the model simpler we could create indicator variables for `CAR_TYPE == SPORTS CAR` and `CAR_TYPE == SUV`.

```{r}
frequency %>% summary()
```

There is no easy way of interpreting the coefficients when using a logit link function. The most inference that we can make is to note which variables are significant. 

- `CAR_USE`, `MARRIED`, `BLUEBOOK` are highly significant
- Certain values of `CAR_TYPE` are significant but others are not.

The output is a predicted probability.  We can see that this is centered around a probability of about 0.5.  

```{r fig.cap="Distribution of Predicted Probability", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, message = F}
preds <- predict(frequency, newdat=test,type="response")
qplot(preds) + theme_bw()
```

In order to convert these values to predicted 0's and 1's, we assign a *cutoff* value so that if $\hat{y}$ is above this threshold we use a 1 and 0 othersise.  The default cutoff is 0.5.  We change this to 0.3 and see that there are 763 policies predicted to have claims.

```{r}
test <- test %>% mutate(pred_zero_one = as.factor(1*(preds>.3)))
summary(test$pred_zero_one)
```

How do we decide on this cutoff value?  We need to compare cutoff values based on some evaluation metric.  For example, we can use *accuracy*.

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Guesses}}{\text{Total Guesses}}$$
This results in an accuracy of 70%.  But is this good?

```{r}
test %>% summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))
```

Consider what would happen if we just predicted all 0's.  The accuracy is 74%.

```{r}
test %>% summarise(accuracy = mean(0 == target))
```

For policies which experience claims the accuracy is 63%.

```{r}
test %>% 
  filter(target == 1) %>% 
  summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))
```

But for policies that don't actually experience claims this is 72%.  

```{r}
test %>% 
  filter(target == 0) %>% 
  summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))
```

How do we know if this is a good model?  We can repeat this process with a different cutoff value and get different accuracy metrics for these groups.  Let's use a cutoff of 0.6.

75%

```{r}
test <- test %>% mutate(pred_zero_one = as.factor(1*(preds>.6)))
test %>% summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))
```

10% for policies with claims and 98% for policies without claims.  

```{r}
test %>% 
  filter(target == 1) %>% 
  summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))

test %>% 
  filter(target == 0) %>% 
  summarise(accuracy = mean(pred_zero_one == target))
```

The punchline is that the accuracy depends on the cutoff value, and changing the cutoff value changes whether the model is accuracy for the positive classes (policies with actual claims) vs. the negative classes (policies without claims).

## Classification metrics

For regression problems, when the output is a whole number, we can use the sum of squares $\text{RSS}$, the r-squared $R^2$, the mean absolute error $\text{MAE}$, and the likelihood.  For classification problems where the output is in $\{0,1\}$, we need to a new set of metrics.

A *confusion matrix* shows is a table that summarises how the model classifies each group.

- 1,489 policies which had no claims were predicted to not have claims - **True Negatives (TN) = 1,489**
- 330 policies which had claims were accurately predicted to have claims - **True Positives (TP) = 59**
- 22 policies which had no claims were predited to have claims - **False Negatives (FN) = 22**
- 489 policies which had claims but were predicted not to - **False Positives (FP) = 489**

```{r}
confusionMatrix(test$pred_zero_one,factor(test$target))$table
```

> **Memory Tip:** Ask these two questions: Prediction Correct -> "TRUE" and Class == 1 -> "Positive"

These definitions allow us to measure performance on the different groups.

*Precision* answers the question "out of all of the positive predictions, what percentage were correct?"

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}$$

*Recall* answers the question "out of all of positive examples in the data set, what percentage were correct?"

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$$

The choice of using precision or recall depends on the relative cost of making a FP or a FN error.  If FP errors are expensive, then use precision; if FN errors are expensive, then use recall.

**Example A:** the model trying to detect a deadly disease, which only 1 out of every 1000 patient's survive without early detection.  Then the goal should be to optimize *recall*, because we would want every patient that has the disease to get detected.  

**Example B:** the model is detecting which emails are spam or not.  If an important email is flagged as spam incorrectly, the cost is 5 hours of lost productivity.  In this case, *precision* is the main concern.

In some cases we can compare this "cost" in actual values.  For example, if a federal court is predicting if a criminal will recommit or not, they can agree that "1 out of every 20 guilty individuals going free" in exchange for "90% of those who are guilty being convicted".  When money is involed, this a dollar amount can be used: flagging non-spam as spam may cost \$100 whereas missing a spam email may cost \$2.  Then the cost-weighted accuracy is

$$\text{Cost} = (100)(\text{FN}) + (2)(\text{FP})$$

Then the cutoff value can be tuned in order to find the minimum cost.

Fortunately, all of this is handled in a single function called `confusionMatrix`.

```{r}
confusionMatrix(test$pred_zero_one,factor(test$target))
```


### Area under the ROC Curv (AUC)

What if we look at both the true-positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously?  That is, for each value of the cutoff, we can calculate the TPR and TNR.  

For example, say that we have 10 cutoff values, $\{k_1, k_2, ..., k_{10}\}$.  Then for each value of $k$ we calculate both the true positive rates

$$\text{TPR} = \{\text{TPR}(k_1), \text{TPR}(k_2), .., \text{TPR}(k_{10})\} $$ 

and the true negative rates

$$\{\text{FNR} = \{\text{FNR}(k_1), \text{FNR}(k_2), .., \text{FNR}(k_{10})\}$$

Then we set `x = TPR` and `y = FNR` and graph x against y.  The plot below shows the ROC for the `auto_claims` data.  The Area Under the Curv of 0.6795 is what we would get if we integrated under the curve.

```{r message=F, fig.cap="AUC for auto_claim"}
library(pROC)
roc(test$target, preds, plot = T)
```

If we just randomly guess, the AUC would be 0.5, which is represented by the 45-degree line.  A perfect model would maximize the curve to the upper-left corner.

# Penalized Linear Models

One of the main weaknesses of the GLM, including all linear models in this chapter, is that the features need to be selected by hand.  Stepwise selection helps to improve this process, but fails when the inputs are correlated and often has a strong dependence on seemingly arbitrary choices of evaluation metrics such as using AIC or BIC and forward or backwise directions.  

The Bias Variance Tradoff is about finding the lowest error by changing the flexibility of the model. Penalization methods use a parameter to control for this flexibility directly.  

Earlier on we said that the linear model minimizes the sum of square terms, known as the residual sum of squares (RSS)

$$
\text{RSS} = \sum_i(y_i - \hat{y})^2 = \sum_i(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^p\beta_j x_{ij})^2
$$

This loss function can be modified so that models which include more (and larger) coefficients are considered as worse.  In other words, when there are more $\beta$'s, or $\beta$'s which are larger, the RSS is higher.

## Ridge Regression

Ridge regression adds a penalty term which is proportional to the square of the sum of the coefficients.  This is known as the "L2" norm.

$$
\sum_i(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^p\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^p\beta_j^2
$$

This $\lambda$ controls how much of a penalty is imposed on the size of the coefficients.  When $\lambda$ is high, simpler models are treated more favorably because the $\sum_{j = 1}^p\beta_j^2$ carries more weight.  Conversely, then $\lambda$ is low, complex models are more favored.  When $\lambda = 0$, we have an ordinary GLM.

## Lasso

The official name is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, but the common name is just "the lasso".  Just as with Ridge regression, we want to favor simpler models; however, we also want to *select* variables.  This is the same as forcing some coefficients to be equal to 0.

Instead of taking the square of the coefficients (L2 norm), we take the absolute value (L1 norm).  

$$
\sum_i(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^p\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^p|\beta_j|
$$

In ISLR, Hastie et al show that this results in coefficients being forced to be exactly 0.  This is extremely useful because it means that by changing $\lambda$, we can select how many variables to use in the model.

**Note**: While any response family is possible with penalized regression, in R, only the Gaussian family is possible in the library `glmnet`, and so this is the only type of question that the SOA can ask.

## Elastic Net

The Elastic Net uses a penalty term which is between the L1 and L2 norms. The penalty term is a weighted average using the mixing parameter $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. The loss fucntion is then

$$\text{RSS} + (1 - \alpha)/2 \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_j^2 + \alpha \sum_{j = 1}^p |\beta_j|$$
When $\alpha = 1$ is turns into a Lasso; when $\alpha = 1$ this is the Ridge model. 

Luckily, none of this needs to be memorized.  On the exam, read the documentation in R to refresh your memory.  For the Elastic Net, the function is `glmnet`, and so running `?glmnet` will give you this info.

>**Tip**: When using complicated functions on the exam, use `?function_name` to get the documentation.

## Advantages and disadvantages

**Elastic Net/Lasso/Ridge Advantages**

- All benefits from GLMS
- Automatic variable selection for Lasso; smaller coefficients for Ridge
- Better predictive power than GLM

**Elastic Net/Lasso/Ridge Disadvantages**

- All cons of GLMs

# Tree-based models

## Decision Trees

Decision trees can be used for either classification or regression problems.  The model structure is a series of yes/no questions.  Depending on how each observation answers these questions, a prediction is made.

The below example shows how a single tree can predict health claims.

- For non-smokers, the predicted annual claims are 8,434.  This represents 80% of the observations
- For smokers with a `bmi` of less than 30, the predicted annual claims are 21,000.  10% of patients fall into this bucket.
- For smokers with a `bmi` of more than 30, the prediction is 42,000.  This bucket accounts for 11% of patients.

```{r message = F, echo= F, eval = T}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
tree <- rpart(charges ~ smoker + bmi, data = health_insurance)
rpart.plot(tree, type = 3)
```

We can cut the data set up into these groups and look at the claim costs.  From this grouping, we can see that `smoker` is the most important variable as the difference in average claims is about 20,000.

```{r message = F, echo = F, eval = T}
library(scales)
library(kableExtra)

health_insurance %>% 
  mutate(bmi_30 = ifelse(bmi < 30, "bmi < 30", "bmi >= 30")) %>% 
  group_by(smoker,bmi_30) %>% 
  summarise(mean_claims = dollar(mean(charges)),
            n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),2)) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  kable("markdown")
```

This was a very simple example because there were only two variables.  If we have more variables, the tree will get large very quickly.  This will result in overfitting; there will be good performance on the training data but poor performance on the test data.

The step-by-step process of building a tree is

**Step 1: Choose a variable at random.**  

This could be any variable in `age`, `children`, `charges`, `sex`, `smoker`, `age_bucket`, `bmi`, or `region`.

**Step 2: Find the split point which best seperates observations out based on the value of $y$.  A good split is one where the $y$'s are very different. * **

In this case, `smoker` was chosen.  Then we can only split this in one way: `smoker = 1` or `smoker = 0`.

Then for each of these groups, smokers and non-smokers, choose another variable at random.  In this case, for no-smokers, `age` was chosen.  To find the best cut point of `age`, look at all possible age cut points from 18, 19, 20, 21, ..., 64 and choose the one which best separates the data.

There are three ways of deciding where to split

- *Entropy* (aka, information gain)
- *Gini*
- *Classification error*

Of these, only the first two are commonly used.  The exam is not going to ask you to calculate either of these.  Just know that neither method will work better on all data sets, and so the best practice is to test both and compare the performance. 

**Step 3: Continue doing this until a stopping criteria is reached.  For example, the minimum number of observations is 5 or less.** 

As you can see, this results in a very deep tree.

```{r eval = T}
tree <- rpart(formula = charges ~  ., data = health_insurance,
              control = rpart.control(cp = 0.003))
rpart.plot(tree, type = 3)
```

**Step 4: Apply cost comlexity pruning to simplify the tree**

Intuitively, we know that the above model would perform poorly due to overfitting.  We want to make it simpler by removing nodes.  This is very similar to how in linear models we reduce complexity by reducing the number of coefficients.

A measure of the depth of the tree is the *complexity*.  A simple way of measuring this from the number of terminal nodes, called $|T|$.  This is similar to the "degrees of freedom" in a linear model.  In the above example, $|T| = 8$.  The amount of penalization is controlled by $\alpha$.  This is very similar to $\lambda$ in the Lasso.

Intuitively, merely only looking at the number of nodes by itself is too simple because not all data sets will have the same characteristics such as $n$, $p$, the number of categorical variables, correlations between variables, and so fourth.  In addition, if we just looked at the error (squared error in this case) we would overfit very easily.  To address this issue, we use a cost function which takes into account the error as well as $|T|$.

To calculate the cost of a tree, number the terminal nodes from $1$ to $|T|$, and let the set of observations that fall into the $mth$ bucket be $R_m$.  Then add up the squared error over all terminal nodes to the penalty term.

$$
\text{Cost}_\alpha(T) = \sum_{m=1}^{|T|} \sum_{R_m}(y_i - \hat{y}_{Rm})^2 + \alpha |T|
$$


**Step 5: Use cross-validation to select the best alpha**

The cost is controlled by the `CP` parameter.  In the above example, did you notice the line `rpart.control(cp = 0.003)`?  This is telling `rpart` to continue growing the tree until the CP reaches 0.003.  At each subtree, we can measure the cost `CP` as well as the cross-validation error `xerror`.

This is stored in the `cptable` 

```{r message = F , eval = T}
tree <- rpart(formula = charges ~  ., data = health_insurance,
              control = rpart.control(cp = 0.0001))
cost <- tree$cptable %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(nsplit, CP, xerror) 

cost %>% head()
```

As more splits are added, the cost continues to decrease, reaches a minimum, and then begins to increase.  

```{r echo = F, eval = T}
cost %>% 
  filter(nsplit > 1) %>% 
  mutate(min = ifelse(xerror == min(cost$xerror),"y", "n")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nsplit, xerror, color = min)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) + 
  annotate("text", x = 25, y = 0.17, label = "Minimum Error", color = "red")
```

To optimize performance, choose the number of splits which has the lowest error.  Often, though, the goal of using a decision tree is to create a simple model.  In this case, we can err or the side of a lower `nsplit` so that the tree is shorter and more interpretable.  All of the questions on so far have only used decision trees for interpretability, and a different model method has been used when predictive power is needed.

You will typically be given the below code, which does this automatically.  To get full credit on decision tree questions, mention that you used cross-validation to select the number of splits.

Once we have selected $\alpha$, the tree is pruned to be shorter.

```{r include = T}
pruned_tree <- prune(tree,cp = tree$cptable[which.min(tree$cptable[, "xerror"]), "CP"])
rpart.plot(pruned_tree, type=3)
```

## Advantages and disadvantages

**Advantages**

- Easy to interpret
- Captures interaction effects
- Captures non-linearities
- Handles continuous and categorical data
- Handles missing values

**Disadvantages**

- Is a “weak learner” because of low predictive power
- Does not work on small data sets
- Is often a simplification of the underlying process because all observations at terminal nodes have equal predicted values
- Is biased towards selecting high-cardinality features because more possible split points for these features tend to lead to overfitting
- High variance (which can be alleviated with stricter parameters) leads the “easy to interpret results” to change upon retraining
Unable to predict beyond the range of the training data for regression (because each predicted value is an average of training samples)

## Ensemble learning

The "wisdom of crowds" says that often many are smater than the few.  In the context of modeling, the models which we have looked at so far have been single guesses; however, often the underlying process is more complex than any single model can explain.  If we build separate models and then combine them, known as *ensembling*, performance can be improved.  Instead of trying to create a single perfect model, many simple models, known as *weak learners* are combined into a *meta-model*.

The two main ways that models are combined are through *bagging* and *boosting*.

### Bagging

To start, we create many "copies" of the training data by sampling with replacement.  Then we fit a simple model, typically a decision tree or linear model, to each of the data sets.  Because each model is looking at different areas of the data, the predictions are different.  The final model is a weighted average of each of the individual models.

### Boosting

Boosting always uses the original training data and iteratively fits models to the error of the prior models.  These weak learners are ineffective by themselves but powerful when added together.  Unlike with bagging, the computer must train these weak learners *sequentially* instead of in parallel.

## Random Forests

A random forest is the most common example of bagging.  As the name implies, a forest is made up of *trees*.  Seperate trees are fit to sampled datasets.  For random forests, there is one minor modification: in order to make each model even more different, each tree selects a *random subset of variables*.

1. Assume that the underlying process, $Y$, has some signal within the data $\mathbf{X}$.
2. Introduce randomness (variance) to capture the signal.
3. Remove the variance by taking an average.

When using only a single tree, there can only be as many predictions as there are terminal nodes.  In a random forest, predictions can be more granular due to the contribution of each of the trees.

The below graph illustrates this.  A single tree (left) has stair-like, step-wise predictions whereas a random forest is free to predict any value.  The color represents the predicted value (yellow = highest, black = lowest).

```{r message = F, eval = T}
library(randomForest)
tree <- rpart(charges ~ age + bmi, data = health_insurance)
df <- health_insurance %>% mutate(
  prediction = predict(tree, health_insurance))

p1 <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bmi, age, color = prediction)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_viridis_c() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title ="Decision Tree") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

rf <- randomForest(charges ~ age + bmi, data = health_insurance, ntree = 50)
df <- health_insurance %>% mutate(
  prediction = predict(rf, health_insurance))

p2 <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bmi, age, color = prediction)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_viridis_c() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title ="Random Forest") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(p1,p2)
```

In most applications, only the `mtry` parameter needs to be tuned.  Tuning the `ntrees` parameter is not required; however, the soa may still ask you to.

Using the basic `randomForest` package we fit a model with 500 trees. 

```{r fig.height=4, include = T}
rf <- randomForest(charges ~ age + bmi, data = health_insurance, ntree = 500)
plot(rf)
```

**Advantages**

- Resilient to overfitting due to bagging 
- Only one parameter to tune (mtry, the number of features considered at each split)
- Very good a multi-class prediction
- Nonlinearities
- Interaction effects
- Handles missing data
- Deals with unbalanced after over/undersampling

**Disadvantages**

- Does not work on small data sets
- Weaker performance than other methods (GBM, NN)
- Unable to predict beyond training data for regression

## Gradient Boosted Trees

Another ensemble learning method is *gradient boosting*, also known as the Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM).  Although this is unlikely to get significant attention on the PA exam due to the complexity, this is the most widely-used and powerful machine learning algorithms that are in use today.

We start with an initial model, which is just a constant prediction of the mean.

$$f = f_0(\mathbf{x_i}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$$

Then we update the target (what the model is predicting) by subtracting off the previously predicted value.  

$$ \hat{y_i} \leftarrow y_i - f_0(\mathbf{x_i})$$

This $\hat{y_i}$ is called the *residual*.  In our example, instead of predicting `charges`, this would be predicting the residual of $\text{charges}_i - \text{Mean}(\text{charges})$.  We now use this model for the residuals to update the prediction.

If we updated each prediction with the prior residual directly, the algorithm would be unstable.  To make this process more gradual, we use a *learning rate* parameter.

At step 2, we have

$$f = f_0 + \alpha f_1$$

Then we go back and fit another weak learner to this residual and repeat.

$$f = f_0 + \alpha f_1 + \alpha f_2$$

We then iterate through this process hundreds or thousands of times, slowly improving the prediction.

Because each new tree is fit to *residuals* instead of the response itself, the process continuously improves the prediction.  As the prediction improves, the residuals get smaller and smaller.  In random forests, or other bagging algorithms, the model performance is more limited by the individual trees because each only contributes to the overall average.  

Similarly to how GLMs can be used for classification problems through a logit transform (aka logistic regression), GBMs can also be used for classification.

**Parameters**

For random forests, the individual tree parameters do not get tuned.  For GBMs, however, these parameters can make a significant difference in model performance. 

Here are the common parameters as in the documentation for `?gbm`.  In general, you should never need to memorize info that is in the documentation.

- `n.trees`: Integer specifying the total number of trees to fit. This is equivalent to the number of iterations and the number of basis functions in the additive expansion. Default is 100.

- `shrinkage`: a shrinkage parameter applied to each tree in the expansion. Also known as the learning rate or step-size reduction; 0.001 to 0.1 usually work, but a smaller learning rate typically requires more trees. Default is 0.1.

- `interaction.depth`: Integer specifying the maximum depth of each tree (i.e., the highest level of variable interactions allowed). A value of 1 implies an additive model, a value of 2 implies a model with up to 2-way interactions, etc. Default is 1.

- `n.minobsinnode`: Integer specifying the minimum number of observations in the terminal nodes of the trees. Note that this is the actual number of observations, not the total weight.

GBMs are easy to overfit, and the parameters need to be carefully tuned using cross-validation.  In the Examples section we go through how to do this.

**Advantages**

- High prediction accuracy
- Closest model to a “silver bullet” that exists
- Nonlinearities, interaction effects, resilient to outliers, corrects for missing values
- Deals with class imbalance directly by weighting observations

**Disadvantages**

- Requires large sample size
- Longer training time
- Does not detect linear combinations of features.  These must be engineered
Can overfit if not tuned correctly

### Exercises

Run this code on your computer to answer these exercises.

**1. RF with `randomForest`**

(Part 1 of 2)

The below code is set up to fit a random forest to the `soa_mortality` data set to predict `actual_cnt`.

There is a problem: all of the predictions are coming out to be 1.  Find out why this is happening and fix it.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
#For the sake of this example, only take 20% of the records
df <- soa_mortality %>% 
  sample_frac(0.2) %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(ifelse(actual_cnt == 0, 1, 0))) %>% 
  select(target, prodcat, distchan, smoker, sex, issage, uwkey) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, ~as.factor(.x))

#check that the target has 0's and 1's
df %>% count(target)
```

```{r eval = F}
index <- createDataPartition(y = df$target, p = 0.8, list = F)

train <- df %>% slice(index)
test <- df %>% slice(-index)

k = 0.1
cutoff=c(k,1-k) 

model <- randomForest(
  formula = target ~ ., 
  data = train,
  ntree = 100,
  cutoff = cutoff
  )

pred <- predict(model, test)
confusionMatrix(pred, test$target)
```

(Part 2 of 2)

Downsample the majority class and refit the model, and then choose between the original data and the downsampled data based on the model performance.  Use your own judgement when choosing how to evaluate the model based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa.

```{r eval = F}
down_train <- downSample(x = train %>% select(-target),
                         y = train$target)

down_test <- downSample(x = test %>% select(-target),
                         y = test$target)

down_train %>% count(Class)
```

```{r eval = F}
model <- randomForest(
  formula = Class ~ ., 
  data = down_train,
  ntree = 100,
  cutoff = cutoff
  )

down_pred <- predict(model, down_test)
confusionMatrix(down_pred, down_test$Class)
```

Now up-sample the minority class and repeat the same procedure.

```{r eval = F}
up_train <- upSample(x = train %>% select(-target),
                         y = train$target)

up_test <- upSample(x = test %>% select(-target),
                         y = test$target)

up_train %>% count(Class)
```

```{r eval = F}
model <- randomForest(
  formula = Class ~ ., 
  data = up_train,
  ntree = 100,
  cutoff = cutoff
  )

up_pred <- predict(model, up_test)
confusionMatrix(up_pred, up_test$Class)
```

**2. RF tuning with `caret`**

The best practice of tuning a model is with cross-validation.  This can only be done in the `caret` library.  If the SOA asks you to use `caret`, they will likely ask you a question related to cross validation as below.

An actuary has trained a predictive model and chosen the best hyperparameters, cleaned the data, and performed feature engineering.  They have one problem, however: the error on the training data is far lower than on new, unseen test data.  Read the code below and determine their problem.  Find a way to lower the error on the test data *without changing the model or the data.*  Explain the rational behind your method.

```{r, message = F, eval = F}
set.seed(42)
data <- health_insurance %>% sample_n(1000) #Uncomment this when completing this exercise

index <- createDataPartition(y = data$charges, p = 0.8, list = F) %>% as.numeric()
train <-  health_insurance %>% slice(index)
test <- health_insurance %>% slice(-index)

control <- trainControl(
  method='boot', 
  number=2, 
  p = 0.2)

tunegrid <- expand.grid(.mtry=c(1,3,5))
rf <- train(charges ~ .,
            data = train,
            method='rf', 
            tuneGrid=tunegrid, 
            trControl=control)

pred_train <- predict(rf, train)
pred_test <- predict(rf, test)

get_rmse <- function(y, y_hat){
  sqrt(mean((y - y_hat)^2))
}

get_rmse(pred_train, train$charges)
get_rmse(pred_test, test$charges)
```


#### Tuning a GBM with `caret`

https://rpubs.com/phamdinhkhanh/389752

If the SOA asks you to tune a GBM, they will need to give you starting hyperparameters which are close to the "best" values due to how slow the Prometric computers are.  Another possibility is that they pre-train a GBM model object and ask that you use it.  

This example looks at 27 combinations of hyper parameters.

```{r, message = F, eval = F}
tunegrid <- expand.grid(
    interaction.depth = c(1,3,5),
                    n.trees = c(20, 40, 100), 
                    shrinkage = c(0.01, 0.001, 0.0001),
                    n.minobsinnode = 20)
nrow(tunegrid)
```

```{r, eval = F}
gbm <- train(charges ~ bmi + age + sex + region,
            data = health_insurance_train,
            method='gbm', 
            tuneGrid=tunegrid, 
            trControl=control,
            verbose = FALSE#Switch this to TRUE to see useful output
            )
```

The output shows the RMSE for each of the 27 models tested.

```{r eval = F}
trellis.par.set(caretTheme())
plot(gbm)
```

The `summary.gbm` function, which R understands from the `summary` function, shows the variable importance. The most predictive feature is `age`, followed by `bmi`.

```{r fig.height=10, eval = F}
summary(gbm, plotit = F) %>% as_tibble()
```

#### Solutions

Q1. Part 1 of 2: Set the cutoff to be lower (i.e., 0.1)

Q1. Part 2 of 2: The Accuracy and Kappa are higher (better) for the undersampled vs. the original data.The up-sampled model is best.  With a cutoff of 0.1, accuracy is 0.66 and Kapp 0.32

Q2. (Hint) Look at `?trainControl`

A bootstrap sample is when samples are taken of the observations with replacement.  The default code was using `method = boot`, which is using a boot strap.  It is strange that this only repeated twice, and each time the data is only train on `p = 0.2` percent (twenty percent!) of the training data.  Because the training data is small, `n` is effectively smaller, which makes the model worse.  Additionally, because there are only two bootstrap replications, there is high variance in this estimate.

```{r eval = F}
control <- trainControl(
  method='boot', 
  number=2, 
  p = 0.2)
```

This is what the default error is

- TRAIN 2581.203
- TEST 5284.176

A good though is to increase the number of bootstrap samples to 10 and to increase the training percentage size to the default of 0.75.  This, however, results in **worse** performance on the test set.

```{r eval = F}
control <- trainControl(
  method='boot', 
  number=10, 
  p = 0.75)

```

- TRAIN 2580.682
- TEST 5286.089

The **best** method is to use repeated cross-validation.  This makes the most use of the data by training over 9-10ths of the observations and evaluating the error on the remaining 1/10th.  This estimate of the error is important because it's how `caret` selects the optimal number of trees to use in the random forest.

```{r eval = F}
control <- trainControl(
  method='repeatedcv', 
  number=10, 
  p = 0.8)
```

- TRAIN 2600.809
- TEST 5280.758

# A Mini-Exam Example

A common regret of students who failed exam PA is that they did not start doing practice exams soon enough.  Here is a simple practice exam to help you to understand what concepts that you should focus on learning, to become familiar with the format, and to test your technical skills with R, RStudio, and MS Word.

## Project Statement

ABC Health Insurance company is building a model to predict medical claims.  Using only `age` and `sex` information from the prior year, build a model to predict claims for the next year.  

### Describe the data (1 point)

```{r message = F}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/sam.castillo/Desktop/R Manual Data/health_insurance.csv") %>% 
  select(age, sex, charges) %>%  #put this into an r library
  rename(claims = charges)

data %>% summary()
data %>% dim()
```

> The data consists of 1,338 policies with age and sex information.  The objective is to predict future claims.

### Create a histogram of the claims and comment on the shape (1 point)

The distribution of claims is strictly positive and right skewed.

```{r}
data %>% ggplot(aes(claims)) + geom_histogram()
```

### Fit a linear model (1 point)

```{r}
model = lm(claims ~ age + sex, data = data)
```

### Describe the relationship between age, sex, and claim costs (1 point)

> We fit a linear model to the claim costs using age and sex as predictor variables.  The coefficient of `age` is 258, indicating that the claim costs increase by $258 for every one-unit increase in the policyholder's age.  The cofficient of 1538 on `sexmale` indicates that on average, men have $1538 higher claims than women do.

```{r}
coefficients(model)
```

### Write a summary of steps 1-4 in non-technical language (1 point)

> ABC Health is interested in predicting the future claims for a group of policyholders.  We began by collecting data on 1,538 policy holders which recorded their age, sex, and annual claims.  We then created a histogram of the claim costs.  A linear model which shows that claim costs increase as age increases, and are higher for men on average.
